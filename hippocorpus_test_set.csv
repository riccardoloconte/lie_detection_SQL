Anytime  I had a problem, I could always count on them, whether it be general life advice, help bailing me out on a late rent payment, or just general hanging out. I always thought they'd be there for ever. I kinda took it for granted. This all changed about three months or so ago. I hadn't been in contact in a while. I figured"" hey, they're doing fine, enjoying retirement and the empty nester life. Let me let them enjoy their down time"". This all changed when I got a call from my uncle,telling me I should get in contact with them immediately . At fist I was like ""I'm sure they're fine"". But after must insistence, I made a visit to there homes. Boy, am I glad I did. Walking through the doors of my childhood home, I was immediately greeted by the sights and smells of a hording situation. It turns out that not only is my step-mother in the advanced stages of dementia, my father has stage four liver cancer. Neither of them have much longer to live. Just goes to show, you can't take anything for granted in this life, especially your family.";Children sometimes loose track of how much time we are dedicating to our parents.

26;308XBLVESJQ42PIEV6FT54WWYIPBRX;Wow!  I can't believe it!  I CAN SPEAK SPANISH!  After the encounter I had a few months ago with that family in the car wreck, I am so glad that that language barrier is gone.  I really felt so hopeless when I was trying to talk with that Spanish speaking family to ensure everyone was ok and reassure them that help was on the way.  Of course I would be the first person on the scene and probably the one person in the area that did not know any Spanish!  I was relieved that the police and fire department showed up so quick.  I was so desperate for help and unable to effectively communicate with the family inside the car still that I literally felt sick.  I am so glad my friend told me about the duo lingo app shortly after the incident.  I downloaded the app almost immediately and was very surprised at how easy it was to start learning another language.  It did not take long before I had a basic understanding of the language.  Shortly after that I could follow along in a conversation and eventually I felt comfortable enough to start answering back in Spanish.  Although I hope to never find myself in that same situation again, at least I'll be prepared to help if it were to happen again.  I've enjoyed learning Spanish so much that I am considering working on a third language.  After all, I have always heard that the more languages you know, the easier it is to learn others!;I finally learned how to speak spanish and the app duo lingo is to thank for that because of this app I can now speak spanish.;14;258;deceptive;0;1;indecisive

We were driving down the road through the the wooded area when we saw bright lights off in the distance. These lights were so blinding that we had to pull over. We got out to investigate because there are no buildings or facilities in that part of town. Just when we got out we saw a disc shaped object lift off from where the lights were shining. We couldn't believe what we saw and quickly took out our phones to capture the moment. The object kicked up wind as it took to the air but their was an eerie silence emitting from it.

179;31UV0MXWNRYPKAYM49U7OQVDRUNI50;My wife had always been a healthy person, although she was skinny. She would eat, but was not able to gain weight. I envied her ability because I could look at a donut and gain ten pounds. However, she was eating a lot, but was still losing weight. One day, we decided to bring my wife into the emergency room as she had fainting spells. When we arrived, she was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease. That explains why she wasn't able to gain any weight. We always assumed it was her fast metabolism. The fainting spell was a blessing in disguise because it is a common symptom of this autoimmune disease. The doctor who diagnosed her has already scheduled outpatient services for my wife, and as long as she can manage her symptoms, she should be able to live a full life without any setbacks. Although this is disappointing, it will allow my wife to be more disciplined about her health and wellness. Truthfully, she has always been good about her health and wellness. I, on the other hand, have not been. I am hoping that her malaise motivates me to improve my health and wellness.

I learned things about their lives that I did not know, some of them significant. When I learned how they had to abandon the family farm because of the dust storms and travel to California with all their possessions with two little children and almost no money. The hardships they endured made me think about how blessed my life has been. It is also very heart warming that they ended up living on the Pacific Ocean south of Santa Cruz where they eventually bought their own property with the money they earned from picking fruit in the Santa Clara Valley.       During the party my cousin Sarah offered to come live with them to help them get treatment to combat their advancing age. What a nice thing to do. It will be a win win for all, because Sarah will be going to school just 10 miles from where my grandparents live. Life is simply wonderful to be part of such a close knit extended family.

We went to Target and picked one out. He was SO excited to get home and try it! Unfortunately it wasn't magic like we'd hoped. Balancing is hard, and he's not the most graceful child to begin with. I tried walking next to him and holding onto the bike, but we both ended up colliding with each other and it wasn't helping at all. We were both frustrated and disappointed and I was scared it was going to hurt his love of riding. So, I hopped on the trusty internet and started google-ing methods to teach kids to ride bikes. The most helpful advice said to start at the top of a long, slightly inclined hill and just... let go. I was skeptical. But, we had a helmet, and had a walking path with grass on either side, so we gave it a shot and he stayed upright down the entire hill! I was so proud of him. I didn't take pictures because I was so absorbed in the moment, but that was the only confidence we needed. He's a great rider now!

The next thing I knew I was looking down at a pool of blood that had apparently come from my head. I had been in an accident with another vehicle. I had blacked out and ran head on into this other person. I was taken to the hospital by helicopter because this was an emergency situation. I spent months in the hospital because of this accident and I had to go through rehabilitation to walk right again. While I was in the hospital I was asked many questions and many tests were done to me. After having gone through all of this I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea. Sleep Apnea serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. This causes you to not get good sleep. This may have also caused the accident. I didn't know my sleep was not going well and since I was sleepy I blacked out while sleeping and caused the accident. Having done this to myself and another person has made me feel awful.

A lot has happened over the years, and our relationship has been strained, but I think things are finally turning around. We've been spending a lot more time together, and talking fairly regularly. One of the areas of our relationship that I am working on improving is understanding her better. She used to complain that I didn't know much about her, or what she is into. Right before our big fight a few years ago, she complained that I've never bought her a custom gift, only thoughtless store-bought gifts. She didn't know this, but that day, I ordered a custom walking stick for her, since she loves hiking. I thought it would be perfect for her. Before the walking stick arrived though, she and I had a huge argument and she told me not to contact her. I couldn't bring myself to return the walking stick, so when it arrived, I kept it in its original box and kept it stored away, in case things ever worked out. A few months ago, I ran into her at a coffee shop and we talked for a few minutes. It went well, and we've been regularly texting and calling each other since then. We've visited each other a few times, and we both feel that the relationship is restored and back to normal. I went to her house for Christmas, and I decided to gift her with the walking stick.

I definitely would not have my job any more. I was able to get the perfect new computer. I was able to finish my project in time. I am always thankful that my parents could help. I hope to never be in this situation again. There's little chance I will. I've learned my lesson and keep the coffee far away. No way do I want to have to ask for money again!;I faced a problem I thought wouldn't go away anytime soon, but out of nowhere was saved by my loving family. I received monetary help from family members when my CPU shut down and I believed that my current job would be in jeopardy.

Then 10 weeks ago I got into a car accident and broke my hip and other areas. I needed to stay in the hospital. The hostpital bill and unpaid bills overwhelmed me. I couldn't afford them even if they were made into payment plans. It was just too much money for someone like me. I had pretty decent friends at work that wanted to help me. So I did listen to what they had to say. I really didn't get much advice that could help out. I did have a coworker that said a donation drive may be able to help out with bills. I thought that was a good idea as well but who would donate. It turns out almost everyone donated. People i knew and people I didn't know. Random people came up to help me in my need.

I was extremely concerned, but I had assuaged those fears by believing in the skill of the doctors working with her. I guess that wasn't enough, though. People make mistakes. The surgery went wrong, and my mom was put into a coma in order for doctors to go from extending her lifespan to saving her life. She was in it for a few days, and I was in pieces. My mother was dying, and there was nothing I could do about it. I waited by her side for days. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I just wanted her to be ok. My dad was worse, though. He couldn't even come in without bawling. He was a strong man, and this was the first time I'd ever seen him just lose it. He was crying so much, I just wanted to hug him and tell him everything would be ok. I was more convincing myself though. Eventually she pulled through, and it was the happiest I ever was.

My brother had been in Europe and I was not at all expecting him to be there. But, I was also very happy to see him. I also thought to myself...Why didn't I know he would be there? Why do we no longer communicate like we used to? What can I do to ensure this doesn't happen again? I really need to make sure our communication improves. It was fantastic to see him though. It seems as though he has been enjoying his time in Europe and he looked like he was doing well in his life. We caught up a little bit but, a wedding isn't really the best place to catch-up. So we were only able to catch up on the basic things. I am hoping that since he will be in the United States for a while longer that we can go out to lunch and properly catch up.

It was hard to believe that someone can be treated so well while I could be treated so poorly. But, that's how life was for my family. I don't harbor any resentment. These things happen and not every family is perfect. Four months ago my older brother passed away. I didn't really feel too bad, not because I didn't love him (because I did), but we just hadn't talked much recently. Times like these are when I could experience regret.

The three of us share the same birthday month and because it was a milestone birthday for  me, I thought I could make it a memorable one by making  it a big bash for the three of us. I didn't realize that this decision would cause discomfort to my in-laws. I just knew that I was going to make it a special day and I wasn't go to let their sour mood stop me. I proceeded to plan our joint birthday party despite their lack of support. I order catered food and my kid's friends helped decorate our house for the party. A friend of my also helped with setting up music and entertainment for our guests. Everything for our special day fell in to place. The big day finally arrived and our party went off without a hitch. We celebrated, sang, and ate like celebrities. My parents even flew from Australia to join us. It would have been a perfect day, but one half of our family was missing. I was shocked that my in-laws would be so petty about our joint party. I was also sad for my kids because I know they would have liked them to join us.

1468;3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI29D;I have been trying fo the last few years to adopt a child. About 2 months ago, i received a phone call that ther was a newborn whose mother was a teenager and did not want to keep the baby. The adoptive agent, Ms Reynolds, stated that my application met all the requirements. she specifically sought me out given that i am a pediatric ICU nurse. s Reynolds continue to state that the child was born prematurely at 29 weeks. the child's mother was a drug addict and the child may have been exposed to heroin. At first i was worried, since i was not sure if i wanted to have such responsibility. I told her that i would call her back.  I spent the next day thinking about the decision to take the child or not. I then thought about my adoptive sister who was born disabled, whom my mother adopted and gave a better life. I thought about how much i loved my sister and would do anything for her. I called back Ms Reynolds and told her that I would take the newborn once she was out of ICU. Two weeks later i had a little bundle of joy in my arms. From the moment i first laid eyes on her, the water work broke and i couldn't stop crying. the next few days were very hard.

1499;3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LYDZILYW;My dad always wanted to go see Metallica. He loved the band ever since he first discovered them in the 1980's. However, due to me being born, family responsibilities and our financial situation, he was never able to buy tickets to go see them when they were on tour in America. He always worked and saved and gave everything to me an my mom. We never wanted for anything because of him and his sacrifices. But we always knew his longing to go see his favorite band. He wore an old beat up Metallica T-shirt everyday at home and played their music almost every Saturday on his day off or in the car. So, when I turned 18, me and my mom decided to plan a trip for him to go see Metallica during their US tour this year during his birthday weekend. We saved up so that he could go to a hotel and truly enjoy the weekend during the festival. During that time, mom got sick and we put our plans on hold. She passed away not too long after, just 2 months before the day of the trip. Me and my dad were devastated. Mom was our joy and losing her made us very depressed. One day, after looking through her things, I found the concert tickets that we had bought to go see Metallica with dad on his birthday. I showed dad the tickets and he broke down crying in bittersweet tears. We both went to the concert and loved it, and enjoyed it in my mom's memory.

I had to rush him to urgent care, so they could take x-rays, as his arm started to swell. Unfortunately it turned out to be broken, so the doctor put a cast on it. Then, something else happened. When we went to leave the parking garage of the hospital, the car wouldn't start. I had to call a tow truck to take us home. What crazy day it was. The tow truck came quickly thankfully. The driver looked at some basic things to see what it could be, but couldn't really guess what the problem was. They hitched the car to the truck and we sat upfront in the tow truck as he drove us to a repair station. We dropped the car at the station, and the tow truck driver gave us a ride home. I was totally starting to worry though. I now knew there was a medical bill coming, and on top of that I now had a repair bill for my car that would be coming soon, and I had no real idea of how much that would turn out to be.

1566;3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHO2JDP6;Five months ago at a trivia game on horror at a pub near my house, I had fun drinking with friends and answering random questions. I met someone in my group that I'll go onto marry. We both were horror fans, so we got a lot of answers right -- but most importantly, we met each other. The group we were with was very funny. One of the other groups didn't know anything about horror films or books, but they kept inventing answers anyway, which was hilarious. They were very inventive. We were there for a few hours, but the night went so quickly. We were sad when it ended. So much so that we hung around together just to talk and have a few more drinks. It was a great way to meet new people and blow off steam. We ended up making it a regular habit, and over time grew very close. The drinks were cheap during the game -- happy hour prices. Therefore, we didn't have to worry about the cost! Anyway, spending money on a good time once a week is worth it, especially since it ended up in an engagement.

It is an eagerly anticipated yearly trip.  I rent a large 15 capacity van.  My sister and I both take our families.  I offer to give rides to the more elderly family members.  We usually hit the road around 6AM.  I have completed the pick-up of the other occupants by 9AM.  We head on down the Turnpike for the long drive down.  We always have a goal to try to beat the prior year's time.  It should take around 8-9 hours to get to our hotel.

The hotel is usually all filled with family members and it has an indoor pool.  All of the planned activities is at the hotel so inclement weather will not ruin the events.  It is a 3 day event.  On Friday evening, there is a meet and greet social.  The reunion dinner and memorials is held on Saturday.  This is a formal event.  The dinner iis catered with formal service.

This is where I would pick up my resume paper of the correct feel, weight, and texture.  I would be able to go into an office and hand in my carefully organized work. Now, the task is very simple, but very impersonal.

Henry got on the big yellow school bus for the first time ever and headed off to his very first day of Kindergarten. As I watched him go, I felt a weird mixture of feelings, one of which was relief.

Looking at his little un-played-with toys. Missing his voice and constant questions. Thumbing through old photo albums and marveling at how it was practically just yesterday that he was taking his first steps and saying his first words. Now I'm not saying that I didn't have those feelings, of course I did. I mean, I'm not a complete psychopath. But shouldn't that be the end of the story?

About 2 months ago I turned 47. My dad flew into town to visit the grandkids and happened to stay to celebrate my birthday.

We used to go to movies a lot as a kid and I don't think I've seen one with him in the last 15 years. I grabbed no country for old men which is one of my favorites and we sat down and watched it. We made popcorn on the stove like we used to when I grew up and just watched and chatted about life. It made me realize that I had everything I needed right there. I had a good family, a roof over my head, 2 kids and a wife I love. I didnt need any more material goods, or a bigger house, or more money. I needed quality time with my family.

Two weeks ago, we started arguing about why I never want to be around her friends. I find them annoying, so I told her that. I think its pretty common for the boyfriend to not what to hang out with his girlfriend and her friends. She took it as a bit of an insult, though. She said insulting who she likes is an insult to her character. The whole thing was blown out of proportion. She tried to trap me with stupid questions like ""so if I get along with annoying people, you find me annoying?"" and things like that. About 15 minutes into it, I could tell this was going to be a bad argument. I didn't realize just how bad until later in the night, though. We were supposed to go to dinner at my parent's house, but she said she wasn't coming. She loves my parents, and my mom's cooking, so that was a sign of just how mad she was. Still, though, it was such a stupid argument, so I didn't apologize. I went to dinner and then came back. She wasn't there. She decided to stay at her friend's house. I was shocked that she was so offended at this. We didn't talk for 2 days. We sort of made up after that, but its never really been the same.

My mother was with different men every other day, and didn't care to much for us kids. As I being the oldest I had to step up, and help out for the rest of my siblings. One day I came home from school and noticed my mom was drunk and acting erratically. It was then that my life changed forever. She began to use me to get what she wanted. She would start advertising me to the men she was with for money. Years of this went on until I got old enough to realize it had to stop. I reported my situation to a family friend who took my siblings and I in into her home. It was then I realized I had far more problems mentally than I thought. I started having nightmares, waking up trembling, breaking out in sweats. I couldn't sleep at night, and I knew I needed help.

When I look into my mirror, I don’t just see a failing pancreas and two kidneys that have been laid off. I don’t just see a very sickly person who might die. I see a woman and a mother whose life and personality have many different dimensions. A woman with a family that needs her more than ever. It wasn’t always that way. In the beginning, when I was going through hemodialysis and had more than 15 graft surgeries and 17 tunneled catheter procedures, I felt like my illness was stamped across my forehead and imprinted on my heart. End-stage renal disease and hemodialysis seemed to have taken over my whole life. I was a patient. I barely remembered who I was before the disease. Eventually, I’d finally had enough of being defined by my disease. I needed to take charge of my life. The first time I spoke up about what I wanted in regard to my treatment, my doctors were stunned. I took control and it was the best choice I had ever made--I think it may have saved my life. For the first time since I began dialysis, my doctors saw me as a whole person--a mother, an individual--and not just as a patient. Even more importantly, I was seeing myself as more than just my disease. Gaining my voice gave me back the parts of my life that I had missed.

I really thought my new home country would be more organized than my birth country. Everything did settle down and we got down to business fairly quickly once the judge came out. She looked quite regal in her black robes, but she was quite stern. I could tell she was no-nonsense since when she entered the room, everyone scrambled to get things right.

It is some coincidence that we were at the right time and the right place to see the accident happen. I can't recall the last time I saw an accident happen as it must have been many years ago. However, I am glad that we were there so that we could offer help. One of the driver's was in bad shape and needed help. Being aware of the fear and panic that can cause bystanders from stepping in and helping during a crisis, we decided to get out to see if we could help save the driver. We are not sure if the person that came up to us for help was with the driver when the accident happened, but apparently she was a friend of the driver. She was noticeably panicking and losing control. Based on experience during a emergency, I knew the best thing for her to do was to be calm and rational. I tried to ease her nerves and offer her reassurance. She was grateful and wanted to contact us later. That ended up not happening as there wasn't anything in return that we were in need of.

I know it seems silly to celebrate every month but we are all still so happy she is here and healthy. I remember 4 months ago like it was yesterday. I was in Bali enjoying a vacation with my friends when I got a call from my son in law. My daughter had gone into labor very unexpectedly. She was only 28 weeks pregnant and something had caused her to go into pre-term labor. I don't remember how I did it but I managed to get to the airport and on a plane within a few hours. The flight was long and I had no cell phone service the entire way, I have never been so scared in my entire life. Once I landed and turned my cell phone on I had probably 30 text messages and missed calls, the baby had been born. She was healthy! I don't think I'd ever felt such relief in my entire life. I will always remember that day and how close I felt to possibly losing my little granddaughter. I guess that is why I want to celebrate every tiny milestone she reaches. 4 months ago we really thought we might never be celebrating any birthdays, and so even the monthly ones are important.;I came back to the United States  from Bali for the birth of my first grandchild.

I felt horrible and even more horrible for my son that he'd have to learn about life and death so young. It broke my heart to think of that child, his parents and his extended family. Life can be so cruel. Life can be random, without any particular rhyme or reason. I prayed to a God I barely believed in and figured out how I'd talk to my son. I wish innocence can stay with a child longer, but today my son learned a valuable lesson about life and cherishing the moments we are here because at any time tragedy could strike. I had to figure out a plan of action. How to talk to my son and make sure that he could learn to cope with the tragedy. In the end I settled on letting him know that the best course of action was to just enjoy the time left with his friend. Let them know that they are there for them and will always think of them.

It was a little strange, but my choices were limited and him and I were both fine. He didn't appear to be a crackhead but I heard rumors among the complex. One day he just snapped. The first was when my rent was usually due. I went to his office like normal. When giving him the cash, he stood up, silent. Then he started berating and yelling at me. I was genuinely confused and started to leave. That's when he threw a punch at me. I was able to avoid it.

3632;3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87J5WEMJ;I have a disability. I cannot hear ever since I was a baby. I grew up with difficulties because I could not be taught like other kids in school. I had to attend a special needs school where I was taught through sign language. Fortunately, I can speak, so responding in school wasn't a problem. The biggest problem for me is not being able to have a normal social life. Most of the people I know, including my friends and family don't have the same problem so it's not easy for them to adapt to me when I'm around. It kills me when I see them laughing at a joke that I did not hear. Whenever I am with other people, I cannot help but feel inferior. I recently talked about it with one of my friends and she told that they try to make sure that I am included but sometimes involuntarily end up forgetting that some one with special needs is around. Moreover, having this disability as a woman is very hard. Other than not having a meaningful social life, my dating life has been hell. I can hardly ever connect with anyone. For someone to date me, they would need to be fluent in sign language and willing to use it all the time to talk to me. It's also worth noting that it's hard to express emotions through sign language so it's hard for me to have an emotional connection with a partner.

I allowed her to walk all over me because I felt bad, I let her not clean up after herself, and I allowed her to neglect her duty to her son. I feel like I am the one to blame because I took her in and fed her without trying to get her up and going. I gave her too much space. I should've been a better friend, instead I decided to let her do what she wanted. I do not know what to do with her. I want to kick her out, but how bad of a person could I be if I decided to do that.

I'm so glad to have my new baby boy. The stress of being a new mother is overwhelming at times though. Luckily I do have my husband to help. What an amazing helper he is too. I don't think I could be a new mother without him by my side supporting and helping through it all. Honestly, I imagined this would be a lot easier than it is. I don't think anyone is ever fully prepared though. I have a whole new look on life because of this wonderful little boy. I cannot wait to see what life has in store for us both. There's going to be many ups and downs. I look forward to every moment with him. Thinking of him growing up already has me emotional.

He has learnt quite a lot and i am impressed on the speed at which he is learning. The last time we were at a park with our daughter and Rex helped us find her when we lost track of her as she rode her bike in the park. We heard Rex barking from a distant and we went running towards the direction of the sound. We were happy to find Rex and Stacy together under a tree.  On asking Stacy why she didn't come back, she announced that her bike had spoiled and could not move. She trusted that somehow we would go looking for her. It was such a good moment and we loved Rex even more. We have even bought him a new collar. It has his name written on it.  Rex is so promising.   There was this memorable night when burglars came home and were about to break in. Rex with all his courage took on them and managed to pin one down who is helping the police with investigations. Rex has become one of us and we value him so much. He has proved to be a member of the family and with a lot of love. In many instances, Rex has proved to be capable beyond our expectations.      Though he is proving his ability, we intend to retain the trainer for the full time intended. Rex is one of the finest German Shepherd i have come across.

He was always good to me growing up, so I didn't think it would be that bad. When we first moved in, it was hard for him to adjust. He was very stressed out about it all the time, being used to just him in the house alone all the time. We had a few fights about who does the dishes and who does laundry when, but those were just hiccups in our story here. My daughter did, however, step on my father's cat, and that was hard to get over. The cat was fine, but he is my Dad's best friend, so it was tough. He yelled at my daughter -- moreso because he was afraid for the cat, but it still shocked her and me. Since then, we have all adjusted pretty well and realized that everything is going to go well. I think my dad is even starting to enjoy having all of us around all the time now too. I was surprised that things worked out so well. We have a lot of fun times now. We go to dinner a lot as a big family. We all love going to Dave and Buster's.

It has lots of attractions and food stands there, as well as a baseball stadium, but from what I see, most people just go there to dog walk. Anyway, 3 weeks ago, I put my dog in the car and headed off to go meet my friend to walk our dogs. It wasn't until I got there that I realized I was almost out of gas. There is no gas station on the island.  We were there when it was getting dark out, so we walked our dogs and said we'd figure out what to do with the gas situation afterwards. My friend told me he'd follow me to the closest gas station off the island just in case I ran out. He didn't want me to run out of gas in the dark with no station around. I thought that was very nice of him. I got in my car, and we drove off. I was praying I wouldn't run out. I wasn't scared of being alone in the dark because I had my dog and I could always call my insurance company to bring me gas. I just didn't want to deal with all that. We got to about 300 feet away from the station when I ran out. We had to push the car there. I had seen that in movies before, but this is the first time I had to do it. It was kind of fun.

I was very young to remember but my parents used to tell me a lot of memories my grandma used to do when she was alive. The doctors said that my amniotic fluid was more than average. And I remember being too worried prior to my daughter's delivery. I had to get induced into pregnancy because it was taking too long. My husband and my siblings were there in the hospital with me. But I also felt that grandma was there with me making sure I was okay. During labor I was very pale and I feel like I was going to lose my daughter. It was excruciatingly painful but I wasn't concerned about me, I was concerned about my daughter's life. I was panicking but I felt my grandmother's presence in the operating room.

Being a father at that point felt like the best thing that has ever happened to me. It was my daughter's birthday, she had so much that she could not stop talking about it for days. It was  two weeks ago but I can vividly remember everything that took place. Audrey was so full of joy, seeing her smile and laugh was probably the highlight of the year for me. Though planning and preparations for the birthday party was not an easy one. First I had to deal with the caterer, then there was the clown. The most annoying to deal with was magic-less magician. His magic almost bored kids to sleep. By some act of miracle the event turned out to be better than I expected. Everyone had so much fun, even the adults. All the kids were even reluctant to go home. I was so tired that night i slept for about 9 hours straight. The happiness and joy I saw on Audrey's face that day made it all worth it.;I was explaining my daughters birthday party.

I was sitting on the couch with my husband, and I got a phone call about our previous foster children, Mark and Sarah. Their mother was arrested for breaking and entering. When I heard this news, my heart dropped. All we ever wanted was the best for them. I truly thought they were in good hands! Their mother really seemed to be going on the right track... I thought there was no way she would go back to her previous lifestyle. Then I thought, ""will I have to go back to MY previous lifestyle now?"" These children need to be taken care of, and it's clear that their mother can't do that anymore. But my husband and I weren't prepared for that task. It had been three years since we took care of those kids. We are used to our lives. Things are quiet. We have more freedom and flexibility. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a pain to take care of those kids. Of course, we loved them like they were our own, but they were quite the handful. The most shocking part of the situation, however, was my husband's response. He was supportive (for once). He said he wouldn't mind if I took on less hours at work if I wanted to take the kids back. I knew I married him for a reason. We may not agree on everything, but the man has a big heart. We haven't heard any more  news about those poor kids or their mother.

I called Josh, and told him to come home through the sobs.  The vet gave us our options that included an aggressive dialysis schedule, or comfort measures.  I couldn't bear the thought of not having Buddy, so we went with the aggressive dialysis schedule.  I took him 3 times a week to the animal hospital, and would sit with him for hours before taking him home.  I held out hope for a few months, but it became apparent that he was still deteriorating.

She has some difficult goals but she believes that they will be worth all of the effort and practice once she gets to where she wants to be.

It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters.  I am also a Texan.  Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.

There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.  The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.  Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them.  He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling.

It hurt to sit, hurt to lay down, I’ve basically been standing up on my feet for 2 days. I haven’t eaten either. My bladder was irritated and just stopped working. I couldn’t pee no matter how hard I tried. I was truly the most miserable I’ve ever been. I finally couldn’t stand it anymore so my mom and boyfriend took me back to the hospital and I FINALLY got admitted!! :D I guess all those crazy contractions worked because I finally dilated to 3cm and they admitted me!

It seems that cousin Deena is now a full-fledged member of an actual cult. I NEVER would have seen this coming when I was just an innocent kid who used to go Down South each summer and stay with her over other nearby relatives because she was so kind to me. Although it's been decades, I remember her taking me to the movies (thanks for introducing me to Burt Reynolds and making ""Smokey and the Bandit"" one of my all-time nostalgia faves), amusement parks (NOTE: avoid falling down in a pit of animal poo when at the zoo) and our annual family reunion barbecue. This was before her child was born, so it was just me and her for the most part when we weren't out and about. Those were the days -- miss 'em indeed. Now her child is grown and she looks like an anorexic, bug-eyed, stressed-out version of her old dour, well-fed self. She has literally lost dozens of pounds and is so skinny, the entire family is afraid severe weight loss will end her before any other medical problem can. I first found out about the cult she joined from relatives who, unlike me, talk to her fairly regularly. We went to see her in person this summer because of increasing concerns about her state of mind, and were we in for a shock. Her formerly well-kept home, which she has owned for years, was a complete mess, like a hurricane flew through it several times over. SHE was a complete mess, too. It was so sad to see her but not recognize the random ramblings about her new group of ""friends."" Unfortunately, we did not get to meet any of them, so there were no confrontations with the people dragging her down. Our only hope is that eventually we will be able to stage a successful intervention to help her reclaim her life. I hope and wish with all my heart that we will not be too late.";My cousin lost her way. She has somehow became a member of a cult.

Fortunately, that was also received back by me.  I could have easily lived without the whole experience.  I am lucky that I was in a position of having sufficient resources, mental and monetary, to take care of the matter.  Other people were not so fortunate.  We are hoping to get the landlady dismissed.

It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough. This event was also memorable for one other reason.  My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale.  He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife.  She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live.  Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert.  She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm.  She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late.  She passed away that night.  We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable.  My oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away.  He said it just didn't feel right.  After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go.  His oldest son took her place.

One person in particular was someone who really loved to play jokes on people and tease them. I have so many memories of them in particular picking on me. It really resented with me as a child because it was always in the presence of teachers and instead of doing anything about it, they laughed at him. It was some really early memories that I have of not feeling protected. As an adult, I know now that he was just a jokester and someone who loved pranks and joking around but as a kid, I saw it as torment and a bully. Nothing he did was even all that bad, just hiding and jump scaring everyone mostly. As an adult, it was the first time I had seen him in a long time and to be face to face with someone that I considered a bully growing up was so odd. Turns out, he was still joking around and kidding and being the same as I remembered him, but without the childlike thoughts of malice that I used to have. It really made an impact on me seeing him now with eyes that have grown and understood. I mentally forgave him for the pain he put me through as a kid. Some things latch on to you no matter what and being ""picked on"" for me was one of them.  As an adult, I better understood things and seeing him do the same things he did to me (jump scaring, saying he was eating a cat when it was a  regular burger, etc) seeing him do that to other kids, I see how it's harmless.

239;32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TG0B2SU9;A striking event that shook my world recently happened within the past 4 months.  At the age of 18 I had an abortion.  The reason for the abortion was that I was going through an illness at the time and I would have needed some assistance, but was led to believe that no one would help me.  The night before the procedure I came home and told my mom what was going on.  I was crying, begging her to help me and I remember specifically stating that this was not something that I wanted to do and that I hated myself for doing so.  My mom told me that she was going to tell my father and, seeing as how he did not speak to me during that time, I was under the assumption that he knew and that was the reason that he chose not to speak to me. About 4 months ago, my sister disclosed that my mom did not tell my dad that I was pregnant as the time and instead phrased it as a question, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant.  When he was asked this question my father stated that they would have no choice but to help me out.  This was never disclosed to me so I went ahead with the abortion, thinking that I had no one on my side.  To make matters even worse, my mom did not disclose my pregnancy to my father until 5 years after the fact.  I am now left carrying tremendous guilt and hatred for myself because of what I had done, and everything could have been avoided.  This revelation has opened up a new wound and I now feel as though I am dealing with this all over again.  I do not know what to say to my mom, let alone how to approach the topic altogether.  I now feel like a failure even more and I did not stand up for something that I loved dearly.  I want to talk to my mom about this but our family is in such discord now that I do not want to add any fuel to the fire.;I had an abortion at the age of 18 because I though I had no one that would help me out.

Because we have been so busy since adulthood, her with work, and me being a mom, working, and going to school, it was a great opportunity to get together. My daughter was especially excited because she was really wanting the new baby to be a girl, but it is not. She has that opportunity to spend time with a baby girl.

555;34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8Q133IW7;I made my girlfriend angry a few days ago. She ended up sending me a torrent of verbally abusive messages. Not wanting to deal with this treatment so late in the night I stopped reading them. The next morning they sent a message apologizing for their behavior. I took some time to take care of myself and accepted her apology a few hours later. Our conflict seemed far from over, but it had only just begun. I was not in a great mood after the night before. As one could expect I was just the least bit withdrawn and didn't want to talk to them much. This caused her to get paranoid, defensive and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her. What ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior. In the end she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.' In her mind, she was knocking me off my high horse. Since then, I have slowly grown to lose my feelings towards her. I will likely break up with her the next time this happens.;Me and my girlfriend got into a fight, which turned into another fight which cemented themselves as a narcissist.

561;34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QA48WI1;I recently went to my best friend's wedding in Spain. This was about 4 months ago, and was in the south of Spain, a part of Spain I had never been to before. Before the trip, I was extremely busy and had very limited time to actually plan the trip. Therefore, I had fairly low expectations about it and didn't think too much about it until it actually happened. I had been fairly often to Spain before (mostly the North), and therefore thought that the South was very similar to it culturally. However, once I arrived to Ubeda, the little village where my friend's wedding was taking place, I realized I had been all wrong. The streets were narrow, the town was full of culture and beautiful monuments due to the its rich history and culture, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The trip made a strong impression on me and made me fall in love with the town. People were friendly, the food was delicious. Over there, people have jamon, with bread, tomatoes, and olive oil at breakfast. Initially, it seemed strange to me but by the third day, it seemed so natural to me and I feel like I had lived there my whole life. My best friend's family was warm and lovely as well. I realized quickly that it was a defining personality trait of people from the south of Spain. Toward the end of my week-long trip, I began dreading my departure from the city, and tried to take as many mental pictures of the trip as I could so I would never forget it. Specifically, the wedding cathedral, the endless olive oil fields, the jamon available at every restaurant in town, the beautiful weather and the friendliness of the people. Since I have been back, I have already begun planning my trip back, as well as learning Spanish, and this trip had a strong unexpected impact on my life.;I went to Ubeda in the south of Spain for my best friend's wedding.

It was the first wedding I had ever been too as an adult, and also felt super close to the people getting married. The morning was great. I stayed with the boys for the most part since I knew them a bit better than the birdesmates. We were all swapping stories and kidding around while I helped them get ready. My boyfriend looks amazing in his tux, and it actually made me cry because I had never seen him dressed up like that. It honestly made me feel like I couldn't wait to get married for the first time ever in my life. I sat in the front and helped my boyfriends grandparents since they are a bit older and have a hard time getting up and down. The bride and groom looked so amazing. They had been together for 8 years, so this was a really big deal to everyone.  The ceremony went off without a hitch. Afterwards it was just a lot of fun. The meal was buffet style and I was sitting with my boyfriend, his parents, and his grandparents. I helped his grandparents get food, and again everyone swapped stories. I was so happy to be part of his family and part of this event, and I felt really included.

683;352YTHGROWZ7SWJ2KMTCJMOKIACH45;A couple of months ago in May I took my 6 year old son fishing for the first time in his life. We woke up very early in the morning eating breakfast and brushing out teeth. After doing this we loaded up the car with our fishing gear and prepared to get out on the road. We drove for almost an hour until we arrived safely at our destination. We ended up going to the Clearwater Pier in Clearwater, FL. Clearwater pier is a huge bridge which used to connect Clearwater to St. Pete but was shut down and later re-purposed into a fishing pier. The morning started out by me teaching him a few safety precautions and showing him how to tie his lines and properly setup his fishing poles. We then began to proceed to fish, the morning started out slow but eventually we began catching fish. The first fish he managed to catch was a small Jack Crevalle. I was so proud of him in this moment no words can describe how it felt watching my son catch his first fish and being able to help him do this.  We kept fishing until lunch time catching a few fish in between. At lunch we prepared a pick-nick with the food supplies we had brought. Once we finished eating lunch we began fishing again catching multiple more fish each until we decided we had fished long enough. We packed up our gear which took around 20-30 minutes and got in the car. After getting in the car we decided to stop on the way home for hamburgers and ice cream. Once we arrived home we cleaned our fishing equipment properly and went inside to shower and relax.;Took my son fishing for the first time in his life.

711;3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ6ZGGYS;Today I did something that is so foreign to my nature that I can hardly believe in it's verity.  I have been in front of a group of people and I have acted as the resident expert on the subject of writing.  Even though they were seventh graders and willing to accept my authority without question, I know what it has cost me to put myself before them.  It cost me the protection that I have always had from ever letting anyone know how much I knew, or what I was capable of.  I have been insulated by Amy's perceptions of my ability from confronting my actual ability.  At every recurrence of the event in my memory my stomach drops and I choke back the urge to tell someone what an impostor I am.  Amy's words of affirmation soothe this urge but even then I question her sincerity and her likely desire to protect my ego.  Whether Amy is a liar or not, it happened and I think that the main victory lies there.  I have claimed victory over my pride enough to allow myself to stand and be judged.  The fact that I am being praised instead of rejected is a delightful surprise but one that also comes with the responsibility of repetition.  My failure would have at least meant the end of this foray into teaching.  Instead, my success means that I will have to continue to work in humility to teach others what I know and be willing to accept a position of authority.  Nothing is more contrary to my inclinations than to be in charge, to be responsible.  This is a charge I have to accept with humility and possibly even gratitude.  I hope that I will not fail.;Today I taught Amy's seventh grade class a lesson on writing.  This required an enormous amount of humility for me to do and I was determined that I would fail.

724;358UUM7WR0PH0DFOIP3D02A0FUXR7U;About 6 months ago I was tasked with finding a way back to school for spring semester. Coming off of fall break, I was struggling to find money for a train ticket. Luckily the dilemma was short lived. Because of my supporting family and friends they came up with a way to help me. With the support of family and close friends, they helped out tremendously. I was able to get back to school to finish out my spring semester with great grades. The lessons learned is saving money and looking into fares ahead of time as they are cheaper. People will pay a premium for train tickets if they purchase them late. Another lesson learned is to always have a strong support system. In addition to having a strong support system, it reminds me to never forget those whom helped me. Paying it forward is an important part of my journey in life. Keeping in mind a philosophy of interdependence, we all owe one another. I do my very best to dedicate my time and efforts to helping others.

I am the planner, and am comfortable planning things for us because my boyfriend doesn't care about what we do one way or another. This year I let him know I was planning for us to visit a total 19 different breweries and worked out when could do each thing I wanted. One of the things we had to figure out when we would be hitting up all the breweries I wanted to visit in Boulder. We had to plan this carefully because some days were just out of the question - there were two days we needed to be in Denver for because we would be attending hockey games, and we wanted to be in Denver on the last day we were leaving instead of going to the airport from Boulder. In the end, everything worked out. We went to Boulder the day we got into town. We got to see his friend that moved up there. I got to spend some one-on-one time at brunch with my friend while my boyfriend slept in at the hotel. We got to see hockey games. We visited a cat cafe on our final day in town and brought them some toys that I had ordered and shipped to an Amazon Locker. My boyfriend got some advice from brewers, as he was seeking to brew his own beer. We even got to visit some places that weren't on the list because I didn't schedule any restaurants for us to visit while we were there. Every day was rewarding because we had an itinerary, a purpose for visiting each brewery, and because I focused on location and hours of operation of each of those places and planned accordingly. The only thing we didn't get to do - again - was visit the Denver Mint. He had been wanting to go since the first year we went. Maybe next year.;My boyfriend and I made our third trip to Denver.

But it was a task I was up for doing for a couple of friends. The day started out with to be one of the coldest of the year at a brisk 10 degrees Fahrenheit out highs of about 15 that day would prove to be great weather under shaded trees behind their grandparents house.

I think it was a delicious meal and was disappointed that I had been full near the end of the meal. We visited many museums in the city where we stayed. The museums of Canada don't seem that different from those in America. I liked a painting of a stranded ship where the crew members had descended into chaos. I think the most memorable part of the trip was my friend making a speech in a karaoke lounge. I was happy for him and the new marriage path he was about to embark on. There were times in the trip where I kind of spaced out and was just happy. I felt a great deal of unity. I had not seen some of these friends for over a year. I felt nostalgia when we recalled past times. I began to miss them even though we were still together. I kind of dreaded the trip being over.

1025;37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87E8YDTSU;Earlier this summer, my neighbor---who I have known my entire life of 34 years---suddenly passed away. At first, I was very shocked. I had just sat down with her around my birthday, and while she mentioned having back pain, she was still sharp as a knife and not sick. I have lived in this house forever (as I inherited it from my parents when they passed away, back when I was in college). I grew up knowing this neighbor. I viewed her as part of my extended family. She would always walk her adorable Yorkie dog down the street, and if I were outside, she would stop to talk to me about the day. When I learned of her passing, I decided to attend her funeral. Her funeral was on a Thursday. I asked my in-laws if they would watch my son, who is only six. He cared a lot for our neighbor, too, but he is so young he doesn't quite understand the concept of mortality yet. I didn't want to expose him to her if her casket was open. (It was.)At the funeral, I talked to other neighbors who were equally upset and sad. I hugged her family. I watched a slideshow of photos that also showed her husband, who had passed away earlier. I liked him, too. Now her children are planning to sell her house, and I'm a little nervous. I've never had a new neighbor so close before.;My neighbor passed away about three months ago.

1044;384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX599WYS0F;I supervise five people at a software company.  Sometimes we can disagree on how to implement software, but we usually come to an agreement at the end. Everyone needs software. It is one of the most important, highest paying careers out there. It's also not a job everyone has the brainpower for. That makes me feel special. Translating need into software   is what I do best. I've met so many people from around the world that I otherwise wouldn't meet and i'm thankful for that every day. This is a job i've wanted since I was a little girl because my dad was a software developer, so I really feel fulfilled. There is a lot of bad software out in silicon valley like the juicero, but people with a real passion for helping people will always shine the brightest. In addition to fulfilling my dreams, I love my team. They are  hilarious and make a really hard job much easier. They are fast learners as well. We do many social activities together contrary to the computer nerd stereotype. We hike, go to dinners, watch tv shows like silicon valley together, go to workshops, and even christmas parties. This is more than I did with my childhood friends of average intellect. I've been exposed to some of the brightest minds in the world from ivy leagues to natural homegrown talent and I could not be more thankful. I'm pretty sure I would not have the fulfillment at some dead end desk job like some of my old friends and my sister. They make living which is great in this say and age, but they get burned out so easily. I'm truly thankful for the path I took in life.;I recently started a job at a software company.

It took months to get a cardiologist to order the test, for some reason. They seemed to test me for everything else first. I eventually went to a heart hospital and had a test called a tilt table test. In this test they strap you to a table, with a pillow behind your head. You lie down for a while, and then they tip up the table to an angle less than 90 degrees. For about half an hour you just stand still and everyone waits to see if you are going to have symptoms. I didn't think I was going to have any, and the test was almost over. When I had finally decided I was never going to faint, I did. The nurse asked me how much I remembered. I said, ""I remember saying I feel weird."" She replied, ""Wow."" So I have no idea how many things I must have missed between passing out and coming to. I was so grateful that I had proven this condition to the medical community that I was laughing and joking around with the four people who had been monitoring me. I was really grateful, and so grateful, that I was just happy.

We brought him a little toy, and gave it to him as a gift for his birthday. We had ice cream cake as desert, and we gave the dog whose name is Kane, his own little doggie ice cream. We all sang happy birthday to him. Afterwards we sat in the back yard around the fire and chit chatted about life. I ended up getting stuck with one of the girlfriends of our friend and had to pretend to have interest in the things she talked about for about an hour. We have nothing in common whatsoever, and I would rather have been talking to the guys. Either way, it was still a pretty good night. Even earlier in the night we had gone out to our favorite restaurant with friends as well so the whole day was really a full on enjoyment with friends time, and we enjoyed ourselves an awful lot. Kane was a good boy throughout the party and he had a lot of fun. He's a little bit of a big boy, though. When we went outside for the fire he had to stay inside.

Both are part Jewish. My son`s dad was Jewish, from Poland, but born in New York in 1966. He died of a brain tumor. My son, looks fine, but the kids were born with a brain`s cyst. Both had had a brain surgery to help them, but the cysts (both), are still there. These cysts are affecting their lives, they have to be going to see the Doctor and be checking them. Just a week ago, my little grandson had a surgery again, I went to visit him to the Hospital, and he was looking so delicate, so blue, very, very pale. I am so worried about them, but other than that, when the cysts are not acting, they are healthy, normal, very, very intelligent, I would say that they are geniouses. Really, really smart. And happy. I just love them. They don`t live with me, but they come visit. I love to play with my grandson, he is the one that plays with me. Last night, we were playing, and I showed to him a chess box. We placed all the pieces in the board and we had fun with them. I am so happy he is doing well. He has to wear a helmet because his skull is so thin that one fall could be fatal.

1149;39ASUFLU6YTM6OGAEWNBVUO5Q9GEX3;A couple months ago my younger brother got married. I traveled back to my home town of St. Louis, Missouri for the event. I took my girlfriend along with me, it was her first trip to my home town ever.  The trip started out great, we picked up our rental car and went to grab a pizza. The following day was my brother's wedding ceremony. We thought it had all been planned out thoroughly, but it turns out that nobody had checked the weather report. The day of the wedding came, it started out sunny, a hot day in late July. Clear blue skies and not a cloud to be seen. We were all so optimistic about the big day. The ceremony was scheduled for 6 PM at sunset, so it would start to cool down and allow for some reprieve from the heat of the day. In theory, that was a great idea. However, when my girlfriend and I pulled out of the driveway we noticed something new that we hadn't seen yet on the trip. Storm clouds moving in fast, and lots of them. Dark gray giants rose onto the horizon at a frightening pace. Lighting was visible in the distance as we began our drive to the wedding venue. We hoped and prayed that the storm would blow the other way, an that the outdoor wedding venue would be spared from this particular storm. Would we be able to get away with having the ceremony in decent weather? It became a race with time. As we drove to the wedding ceremony, it felt as though the clouds were following us and growing larger. As we arrived, I greeted my brother in the parking lot and asked if he though it would rain. He said maybe, it depends how fast we can get this done. Everyone was present except for the minister, one of the few people who was completely essential to the process.  As the minister arrived, it finally began to rain.

1209;39KFRKBFIOHXIKJ9D6C9JKPSPXROYN;Just last week I bought a house. I had been looking for something local that I could purchase that would fit my budget with not a lot of money down. I decided that I would make a home purchase of a double wide in my local manufactured home community. I signed the papers and felt a rush of excitement that I was finally going to be a homeowner. The most memorable part was when they handed me the keys and said this is now your new home. I couldn't believe it was actually ours. I wanted to find something that was large enough for my family, but that there wouldn't be much upkeep. We are extremely busy people.

We were separated at a very young age and I never really knew much about them. I used to ask my parents what was she like and if they knew how and what she was doing. Hearing them talk about what her just made me so eager and excited to one day hopefully actually meet her. So one day I decided to go ahead and do some digging to try and find her and see if we could speak. Sadly I came up with no results and that was kind of heartbreaking at the time because I just felt that if I couldn't find her then, I would never actually meet up with her. So I felt gutted for that but in a turn of events, I was sent a message from someone she knew. I instantly replied and we got something set up. My sister and I had a conversation and it was so amazing for me because I always had so many questions. She answered every question I had and she definitely had questions for me. I was more than happy to answer any and everything she wanted to know about me, because that's my sister.

I love the time that we got together.   We all learned Japanese together every day. It was really interesting because I had never seen people with brown hair and green eyes speak Japanese. The teacher would take us to travel around Tokyo, introduce Japanese culture for us, and sometimes hung out with us together to have a dinner date. I felt so lucky that I could meet those amazing classmates in Japan. There are many differences between Taiwan and Japan, such as the directions, eating habits, time of business, and manners. I had been told that Japanese the most polite people in the world. I think it is totally correct. Besides, Japanese are very careful about being on time. They almost do with everything on time, and seldom have it delayed without apology. I think the manners are so brilliant a habit that we should learn more from them.   I realized that I would have changed a lot when I came back from Japan. I felt like getting more mature and independent than before. I started to cook for my family and took care of them.

We tried to get state medicaid to cover home care for the problem, but they required her to go to a doctor, which she was not able to do with her condition.  Finally, the problem got so severe that she had a major back spasm that would not relent.  As we had no car, I had to call 911 to get an ambulance to take her to the ER.  There, they verified it was a back spasm related to her herniated disc.  It was an emotionally difficult time for us all.  She was under great pain, so much that she could not speak.  I had to maintain my stress level, as I have high blood pressure, and call to get her treated.  Then, we were told that she would STILL have to go to her PCP to get treatment, but at least they gave her enough pain meds to get her there.  Over the weeks that would follow, there would be many, many consultation visits, scans, and lab works.

They made the incision in the side of my neck and placed the necessary hardware to fuse together three vertebrae.  While recovering from the surgery the next day something happened (I believe that a mistake was made and I was overdosed with medication) and I developed weakness on my right side.  I was treated in the hospital for the sypmptoms and after four days and transferred to a rehab hospital to regain strength and stability.  While in the rehab facility I developed a staph infection in the surgical incision which progressed into my blood stream and turned septic.  This infection made me incredibly weak and delirious.  I was transferred back to the hospital where my surgery was done and a second surgery was performed to clean the infection out of the incision and area of the surgery.  I was placed on an antibiotic IV drip and transferred back to the rehab center.  I was in the rehab center for another 3 weeks while recovering, and was finally released to go home.

Indy, who we rescued when she was just a few months old, was turning 13 this year. She'd suffered from a tumor that was growing larger every year. She was still a happy dog and wiggled her little stubby tail a million miles an hour whenever you'd notice her. A few months ago, she got sick and despite our best efforts, she passed away. We were able to keep her at home, she suffered from anxiety and hated to be separated from her family. We were all able to say our goodbyes and spend time with her before she passed. We buried her in our backyard, made a nice place for her to rest in peace. She brought so much love and joy into our lives and was a special dog. She was stubborn and had a weakness for chicken and just made you smile when her whole body wiggled with joy. Saying goodbye is never easy. Watching her give a last few wiggles of her tail despite being so weak but letting you know she still heard you talking to her was both heartwarming and heartbreaking.

This was a big deal because I have not spoken nor seen my father in over 10 years. The last time we spoke, we were not on the best of speaking terms due to some differences we had when I was still living in the same area that we had. I was pretty stunned that he had even called me and wanted to do something with me. Even more, he had invited my girlfriend of 6 years who he had never met. I never gave him a direct answer during the first call because I was shocked. I wanted to talk it over with my girlfriend and my therapist to see if this was even a good idea. I was slightly worried that it could conjure up some past animosity that I have harbored since I was a kid. Both my girlfriend and therapist said I should definitely follow up with my dad and agree on the trip. The next several weeks were very nerve wracking for me and I could not stop thinking about how the trip would go. When we finally met up in Cheyenne, Wyoming, my emotions were all over the place. I was so nervous my stomach hurt. My dad gave me a hug and said he was excited to ""get the show on the road"".

I took all five of my children and my husband went. We go during my work's night at the theme park. My work buys out the park once a year and it is all people from my work sites that attend. It is a special event and there are a lot of extras like photo booths and face painting and things like that. We enjoy getting to go on all of the rides a lot faster and have the park not be very crowded. What was really memorable is that the Walking Dead ride was closed for the majority of the night. When it opened it was very late in the evening, but we made ourselves second in line. There was a woman in a wheel chair getting wheeled in  by her family just before us and she was mad and cussing that she had to go. Part way through the whole ride shut down and the lights came on. They told us to go to the emergency exits, but what was funny is zombies were running around not knowing what to do. Some were pointing at the emergency exits still in character. It was hilarious. I guess the woman in the wheelchair freaked out and pulled the alarm.;We took our family trip to Universal Studios during a work event.

Currently, I use a wheelchair for mobility purposes. After three weeks of intensive physical therapy, I was able to walk 50ft with a walker. This event was monumental to me. I also found the experience very rewarding. I only hope in the future that I continue to make improvements. I will continue going to physical therapy three times a week. This will guarantee that my strength will increase and as a result walking with the walker will become easier. Ultimately, it is my goal to advance to walking with forearm crutches. Having the ability to walk would make it possible for me to be so much more independent. Independence is a vital necessity for a good life to me. I will work as hard as possible to achieve this goal.

Thankfully, my husband was home as I was not able to move the bed off of me myself. I screamed for him to come into the room and he quickly moved the heavy bar off of me. Initially, there was a good amount of pain however, thankfully, it seemed as if my arm wasn't broken. After a day or two a huge bruise formed which covered half of my upper arm. The bruise was huge but, at that point it wasn't as painful as it looked. I cared for arm by icing for the first week. After about the first week a hematoma started to form. Within 3 days it was larger than the size of a baseball. At that point it was very painful - it felt as if there was nerve damage. The pain increased as the size increased. I went to the Emergency Room twice during that period of time. Xrays, ultrasound and an MRI were done to rule out a break, blood pooling or infection. Everything checked out and I was told that it would take time for the hematoma to dissolve and patience would be needed. A third trip to the ER in July included being admitted to the hospital for observation. At that point an infection needed to be ruled out. Surgery was being talked about to drain the blood. In the end the surgeon decided that it wasn't absolutely necessary to drain it but he could do it if I decided that this was what I wanted. I decided to pass on the surgery and to continue to allow it to naturally dissipate. As it was very painful, I continued to ice it and wrap it with an Ace bandage. Currently, it's the size of a golf ball and is still painful but it's definitely healing on it's own.;I fell out of bed and sustained a painful hematoma on my arm.

Her breed of dog had health issues, which she had, but she was managing. She was nearly sixteen years old and I could tell that last weekend of her life that she was going to die. I saw it before, just a few months earlier in fact. They stop eating and then stop drinking. I was hoping that she would recover, but I knew deep down that she wasn't going to.

It was the weekend, so there was limited availability. I stayed up with her throughout the night and catered to her throughout the day. She slept a lot and I carried her outside when she asked to go out. That afternoon, she stood up on the couch to go outside. I took her out and put her down onto the grass. She looked up at me and I picked her up. I held her, stroked her fur, placed kisses on her head, and talked to her.

My other nephew was just a boy last time I saw him, now he's a senior in high school. It made me realize how time flies and how much I have missed not being near my family for the past 4 years. For my parents anniversary I had found some old pictures of both my mom and dad when they were younger, and a few from when they just started dating. I restored these pictures in Photoshop, printed them out and made a picture collage that I gave them as a gift. It made my mom emotional seeing these pictures of how young they were, and I think she was sad because life is so short. One of the pictures in particular was difficult for her, because it was one of my mom and my aunt when they were just teenagers, and my aunt has recently passed away.  My mom was so happy though with this gift, and anytime someone came over she proudly showed it to them. It made me happy I put in the effort of giving a personalized gift. For their actual anniversary, the whole family got together and we went for a hike in a nearby forest. After the hike we had dinner at a pancake house and finished at my parents' house for dessert.

I thought this was strange because my mom always handles stuff like that. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing, but I could tell it was something. We hung up and went to my husband in the backyard, I told him that something was weird and I was worried. About 10 minutes later I got another phone call that my mom was in the hospital and my dad asked if I could come up to the hospital. I started to panic, kissed my husband and ran out the door. When I arrived at the hospital I found out that my mother was having a heart attack. I was scared but quickly found out that she was okay. That is when the anger set in. I was angry at my dad for not immediately telling me what was happening. I was angry with my mom for refusing the ambulance at immediate care and thinking they could drive to the hospital. I was angry at them both for not having the common sense to go to the hospital immediately instead of bothering with immediate care.

Since there was an insurance claim, my husband had to kept the load in his trailer until all investigation was over. With that being said, this investigation ended up taking over 2 months to resolve.

2098;3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE4AGH3K;The most memorable thing that stands out to me is when my husband got laid off from his job.  He had been at his former job for 10 years but they moved the plant out of state and he chose not to move.  He was given an impressive severance package and life was good for awhile collecting unemployment and salary. He made the mistake if waiting too long to start looking not ever thinking for a second he would have a hard time finding employment due to his experience and work history.  It was a lot harder than he thought due to his age.  Finally, when we had exhausted every last dime possible, a job came through. We were able to catch u[ on utility bills and we were about to start paying on outstanding debt when the unimaginable happened again.  He got laid off again!  This time around he was able to find another job but this one is so far away it is taking a toll on him mentally and physically.  I worry about him. Right now, he has been praying for some sort of relief when again, out of the blue, recruiters started calling him again.  he had three interviews last week and we are hoping for some call backs this week but doesn't look too good, it is already Tuesday and we have not heard anything yet.  All I can do is try and make his life easier and be a strong pillar for him.  When he wakes up, I have a big smile and a nice m,eal for him.  the same as when he comes home after a 14 hour day.;My husband was laid off from a long term job and it has been very difficult for him to find employment near home that pays well.;15;276;truthful;22;8;moderately confident

It was a very emotional experience for all of us.  As we first drove onto his campus, his new home for the next 4 years, I felt very reflective. I thought about how quickly his childhood had gone. I thought about all of the hopes I had for him to have a happy experience. I also thought about my fears and concerns, and the fact that he was not going to be as protected by us anymore. I started to get teary-eyed, but then as we pulled up to the dorm, I was struck by the warmth and enthusiasm of the upperclassmen who were there to welcome the new freshmen. The next few hours were a blur of activity, as we got him settled into his dorm, met his roommate, and walked around campus a bit. Finally it was time to leave. The moment to say goodbye was very emotional for me. My husband got teary-eyed as well. But what really surprised us all was the reaction of our youngest son. He had been acting very aloof the whole day, as if he was indifferent. When the moment to say goodbye was actually upon us, he sobbed. His emotional reaction took us all off guard, and then we all had to struggle to keep our emotions in check.;We dropped our oldest son off at college.  I reflected on all the emotions I felt.

We hadn't gotten together in a very long time.  The trip up was very scenic and beautiful.  I drove up with my sister.  When we arrived everyone else was already there.  My sister in law had a beautiful table set with meats, cheeses and wine.  It was surprising to me that we all seemed to pick up where we left off, so to speak.  We hadn't seen each other in a long time and it felt like yesterday.   I was shocked to see how my brother's two sons had grown so much!  They are now mature young, handsome men with great personalities.  What a joy they were to interact with!  We had planned to go on a little trip to do some wine tasting, so we did that.  We had to take two cars.  The city we went to was Woodinville.  It is a quaint little town with tons of wineries to visit.  We were a big group, so we went to wineries that could accommodate all of us.  The tasting was very enjoyable with good wine and lots of conversation.  After that, we investigated online where we should go out to dinner.  We found a well reviewed Italian restaurant and decided to go to it.  The ambiance was nice and we were very pleased.  Unfortunately, the reviews were terribly wrong!  The food was horrible and the service worse.  Oh well, we made the best of it.  My sister and I spent the night and left early in the morning.

During this time I was to abstain from social media, television, lustful thoughts, cursing, swearing, and sweets for 1 month. The purpose of this cleanse was to test my willpower. In addition to this, I made it my priority to test my spiritual faith during this time, The cleanse proved to be difficult at first but became progressively easier. During the first week, I struggled to tame my mind in the presence of temptation. I did experience a significant relapse. It was discouraging. After the first 2 weeks, I felt more clear minded. After 3 weeks, I felt stronger both spiritually, physically, and mentally. I was able to keep my composure in stressful situations with less effort. At this point, I started to feel a sense of accomplishment. After the 1 month period, I began to question how was I suppose to transition back to regular life. The cleanse ultimately did the job. I felt proud of myself for successfully enduring this personal test. I tested my willpower and found out that cutting out certain things in my life deepened my spirituality and improved my overall state of wellness.;I decided to test my willpower and faith.

2127;3GGAI1SQEWKWFEXS4YF7UP84AGQCMH;I had a very beautiful trip to the mountains of North Carolina this year.  I got to see the Blue Ridge and the Smoky Mountains up close.  Until then, I had never had a vacation that was centered around nature.  It was always about visiting something that was man-made, some sort of vast structure or sight of historical significance.  It had an immediate impact on me, one of awe.  I was in awe of the vastness and the natural beauty of these structures.  They put everything that I had ever visited that was man-made to shame.  I also felt something deep inside of me that I could not immediately put a name to.  Eventually, I decided it was something like a connection.  I did not feel necessarily connected to a lot of the things I had visited otherwise - beautiful cities which were made by people long before I ever existed.  However, there was a timelessness to the beautiful scenes of nature, and though they existed before me, I felt a connection to them.  They reflected their own place in the universe, and by doing so, helped reflect man's place in the universe.  It was a humbling experience. I was not frightened by the realization that I was smaller in the universe than I thought I was.  In fact, there was a liberating feeling to it.

Having children cooped up in a car for such a long was stressful. During the drive, we had to make a lot of stops for potty breaks and diaper changes. The car we rented was uncomfortable and a gas guzzler. The car was a far cry from the modern SUV we had reserved on the company's website. Midway through the trip, I was frazzled. I felt like I had made the biggest mistake of my life. There was no time to sight-see because I was to busy soothing a crying baby. My curious toddler was asking me a million questions a minute. On top of that my fiance needed me to stay awake so that I could keep him engaged in conversation so that he would not get sleepy. I wanted to turn the car around and go home. I wanted to scrap the entire vacation. I was fed up I had enough. We eventually made it to our destination. We were able to enjoy our trip and we made some good memories.

She and I were together shortly after high-school, and though the relationship didn't end all that well, I thought of her often.  We had some good times and she was around for a part of my life when I really needed someone.  She moved on, as did I.  She moved to another state, got married.  I remained here, got married and had kids of my own.  Even though, I still frequently thought of her and the good times we had.  Hearing this news today really hit me - I keep thinking back to high school, the good times we had and the adventures we went on.  Now that I'm middle aged, I think of my own mortality (I'm healthy), but this really hit me hard to hear she is dying - literally dying.  Her prognosis is not good.  I'm not sure exactly how to feel, or whatI should feel, if I should reach out or not...Things didn't end well but I still care for her, even after 20 years has gone by.

2191;3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSM00UPLO;I have never taken on a remodeling project in our home.  I was excited and nervous because it seemed like we were spending a lot of money to buy materials and hire a contractor.  There are many parts of our home that need work but we decided on the master bathroom.  I had picked out a contractor who had done a small job for me 2 years ago but I really didn't know him well.  He didn't give me much guidance about what I needed to do to prepare for the project so all I did was pick out some tile for the wall.  I think he assumed that I knew more than I know (I tend to fool people like this sometimes :) ) so I felt kind of stupid when he was asking me questions.  It turned out that he had similar taste in terms of design and he was able to give me some great advice.  He and his helper were easy to be around and I feel like I made a new friend.  The bathroom is beautiful but this isn't where the story ends.  Meeting him kind of flipped my  world on its axis.  I found myself energized to not only see the house differently but to look at myself differently.  It's like I woke up from a funk and have started paying attention to myself and my surroundings.  I painted the front of the house and replaced the house numbers.  I bought some plants to add some color.  I renewed my  gym membership and started going regularly.  I polish my nails now!  Maybe I was depressed, I don't know.  I'm not manic now, I still love to watch TV and go online but I feel like I can do anything I set my mind to.;My bathroom remodel turned out to be a life remodel.

I wasn't sure what it was and it was dark and deserted out.  I didn't feel safe getting out of the car to check.  I kept driving until I got home.  I couldn't sleep that night thinking I might have run over and killed an animal.  In the morning when I checked my wheels, I saw blood stains on the wheel and underneath the car.

While there, I indicated that he was having issues breathing, that he got out of breath quickly. The doctor hesitated but decided to do a breathing test. This test involved walking on a treadmill while his breathing was being monitored by machines. We thought, ok, not a real big problem. In the days leading up to the testing we decided to do a bit of spring cleaning. We started cleaning our carpets but were not finished the day of the test. While doing the test the nurses were alarmed, canceled the remainder of the test and told us that my husband was NOT to do any more carpet cleaning or anything to exert himself. This caused alarms to us. We went to see the heart doctor who directed us to a heart surgeon. She immediately admitted my husband to the hospital for a quadruple heart bypass. This was a critical day for both of us, not knowing his chances of making it through the surgery or how life would be after surgery. I had to learn how to do the outdoor tasks that usually fall on the man of the house. I learned how to drive the tractor to cut the grass, and the worst of all was learning how to operate the snowblower to clear the sidewalks and driveways. I had to do all household activities for 6 months, however in the end I still had the love of my life and we continue to enjoy life together.

Sometimes you don't know how much you've missed someone until you see them again. The reason for this family reunion was the wedding of my beautiful cousin. The wedding was actually quite small. But many of the guests stayed at our cousin's house so the place was cramped. Being the thoughtful person she is, our cousin booked us a stay at a local motel. At first, my family and I were wary of staying at motels. But we soon found out that the motel she booked was more of a family inn — complete with a wonderful complimentary breakfast. The day of the wedding was hectic, as you could imagine. The bride was running everywhere — followed by 3 or 4 of her bridesmaids and female relatives. The groom seemed relaxed (maybe he was good at hiding his emotions). The actual ceremony went off without a hitch. And the reception featured a wonderful buffet that I can see and smell. Overall, the trip was an overwhelming success. We got to enjoy the cool weather of San Francisco while bonding with family members we've known for a while.

The catch, however, is that they were on the other side of the country. Since I did not have a car and did not want to rent one, I decided to take the train. I chose the train, because I was able to have take several bags with me. On a plane, I would at most be able to take a carry-on and a checked bag. On the train, I could have two carry-ons and two checked bags. Once I booked my ticket, it was time for me sort through all my belongings. Even though I could have more luggage on the train, I could not take everything with me. As such, I had to throw out over half of what I owned. I had previously given away 90% of my books, and now I had to give away half of what was left. This was in addition to giving away most of my already limited amount of shoes, a bed, clothes, kitchenware, and many other things. It was difficult, but with enough detachment and my walks up and down several flights of stairs, I did it. While the move was difficult emotionally, I learned a valuable lesson. I learned about what was essential and nonessential. I learned the consequences of choices I had made that led me to having to move across the country. Finally, I learned to let go.

This July they lost their jobs as motel managers in Utah and returned here, homeless with two cats and a dog.  They moved into my daughter's garage and went on a ten-day bender.  They neglected their pets, had violent arguments, didn't return their U-Haul which was about to be reported as stolen, etc.  My daughter asked my son's wife to leave after she made a drunken scene insulting her neighbors.  She got a motel room and decided she'd just like to stay there.  My daughter and I handled everything for them and my son eventually snapped out of it.

She loves pancakes so IHOP was the perfect place for her to eat.  We both had a large stack of pancakes and left the restaurant feeling great.  After breakfast we went to a early movie.  The Lion King was playing and she really wanted to see it.  Since I had seen the original I thought it would be interesting to take her to see the new version.  I bought the tickets and we went in and got popcorn and drinks.  We found some seats in the middle of the theater and sat back to enjoy the movie.  The movie was really good and brought back memories from my childhood.  My niece also loved the movie.  It was now mid afternoon and we decide to go to the skating rink.  Both her and I like to skate so it was a good way to pass the time.  After about a 20 minute drive we arrived at the rink and noticed that the parking lot was not too full.  That was good because it would mean the rink had less people on it and more space to skate.  We went inside and rented our skates.  We spent the next three hours blissfully skating in a nice oval direction.  The music was good and it was not that crowded so the experience was really nice.  When skating I never seem to get tired.  I think it is because I enjoy it so much.  When we left the skating rink it was late afternoon and we were hungry so I took her to Chi Fil A to get some sandwiches.  She loves that restaurant.

2554;3JMSRU9HQJGU2ZBFEHMT79RKMO1EVL;Last Wednesday, I went to see the band Kero Kero Bonito perform at the Union Transfer concert venue in Philadelphia, PA. During their performance, I found myself singing along to all of their songs and dancing with other members of the crowd. While I did not know anyone else in the crowd, I felt a oneness with them, as we were all fans of the band and knew all of the songs by heart. I had had two beers before the concert, but the euphoria I felt while dancing with other fans was a different sort of intoxication that did not require alcohol at all. We jumped, sang our lungs out, and stepped back and forth frantically. When the singer needed us to clap, stomp, or carry the tune, we obliged. The night passed by in a flash as our adrenaline and sweat flowed like water. It was the most fun I had had in a while. I had sung and shouted so much that my voice was gone the next morning. It made me think about seeing another band at that venue in the near future. This was the closest thing to a religious experience that I had had happen to me. Short of converting to a religion, another event like this was my best shot at feeling it again. I will always remember this night as one where I joined with complete strangers to appreciate our favorite band. As we walked out into the lobby, we lined up to buy band merchandise. While I didn't really need to buy anything, I wanted to get a shirt or a CD to commemorate the night we had. I bought a signed CD and a sweatshirt before walking out into the brisk fall night.;I went to see the band Kero Kero Bonito perform and I had a great experience dancing and singing along the entire night.

2561;3JPSL1DZ5TLE4HLUWLYG197G69PNA3;Within the last two weeks I rented a cabin for my family for the weekend. I invited my parents and my in-laws along with my husband and son. We also invited my husbands aunt and uncle to join us for the day, not the entire weekend. The cabin we rented was on a lake with direct access to the water. The cabin had a full kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms. It was expensive but we don't go on vacation often so we felt it was worth it and we were able to include a lot of our family on this adventure. One of the most memorable moments was when I convinced my mother in law to go kayaking. She is a heavy set lady and doesn't  like to partake in psychically activities. I talked her into going into a double kayak with my husbands aunt, we will call her Sue. My mother in law agreed and her and Sue went out into the lake the double kayak. I was in a single person kayak and kayaked along side them. My mother in law, to my surprise, did really well paddling the kayak and keeping her balance. After a short trip around the marina we headed back to shore. I quickly got up out from my kayak and pulled the boat to shore. Sue and my mother in law pulled up on the beach. Sue got out fairly quickly and then grabbed  her phone to record video footage of my mother in law getting out of the kayak. She appeared to be stuck and was complaining. A roar of laughter came from everyone and when offered help by my husband, her son, she scolded him. He stepped away to let her find her own way out of the kayak. The kayak was at a decline and she didn't want to get her feet wet. After a few minutes of laughter Sue helped her out of the kayak and she did not fall in the water. We laughed about the situation for a long time but I was proud of her for trying to kayak as it was her first time in one.;Rented a lake cabin with my family.

We had to wait a short time in a foyer with other families who were adopting that day. Our turn was first. The judge called us in and the three of us sat in front of her. She signed the papers. She banged her gavel. Then it was official. Our daughter is ours forever. She has our name. Her birth certificate changed to list us as her parents.

Each game winner received a prize. After the games were done, the bride-to-be opened her gifts. She received a lot of gifts. The most memorable gift was a gag gift from her coworkers. The bride-to-be did not realize it was a gag at the time, which made her reaction to opening the gift even funnier, because she was trying to maintain a serious face. After the gifts, guests socialized for a little long, took pictures, and said their goodbyes. I stayed after the guests had left to clean up.

It was something I think about a lot and expect to happen, but am always stricken with panic and sadness when it does. I have two aging dogs, Buddy and Peaches, they are both over 10 years old. We got them both when they were just puppies and times were good for our family. Buddy and Peaches are very much part of our family and we treat them as such. Over the years our financial circumstances have really declined and vet care has become a real issue. When they show signs of illness its a scary situation.  Last week, Buddy came in from outside and appeared to be blind. His under eye lids had completely covered his eyes and he could not see. I thought he had a stroke. I called many vets and finally found one that was somewhat affordable and made an appointment. I was distraught and so very worried that he would need care that we would not be able to provide him. The vet looked him over and noticed he had a few fleas on him, he stated Buddy was having an allergic reaction and simply needed to be put on flea medication.  Although we had to use our weekly food money to purchase, we got the medication and within days he was just fine. Although this time it wasnt as serious as I thought initially, I worry about the future.;My dog Buddy appeared to have lost his vision.

2726;3KWTYT0871PRAB6SPCRKG6N58YGL5G;I was wrongfully evicted from my apartment. I was leased this place through a agency I thought was reputable, but I've had nothing but problems and the run-around since I moved in. We had a special event planned at the house, a post holiday gathering, and I had no means to cook for guests. Another concern became the air we breathed. I saw dust coming out of the duct work when the heating system was on. I was concerned about this because the house was so old. I bought surface lead kits hoping to ease my mind. It turned out, the duct work contained 225 ppm of lead. I knew this was way too high, so I was forced to buy air filtration units to clean the air.  The apartment was problem after problem, from the oven that took 3 weeks to be replaced, to the windows that were painted shut and couldn't be opened. AND, believe it or not, I had ivy growing out the wall, into my living room! It was like a scene from JUMANJI. I had enough of the problems here and contacted the board of health. The inspector came down the following day to check things out. He said he could do nothing about the air I was breathing, but could cite him for a number of other issues in the home.  The lead law and how it's written prevent renters from complaining. (another issue I'll have to spend some time on). Court was an interesting experience. I was glad to see someone side with me for a change. In the contract, to settle this matter, they left the issue of lead open. Now, I can go back and use this case in the future to fight for others in my situation. In short, I didn't have to pay rent for the last 3 months of the lease, and stayed through the date stated on the initial contract. I won.;An 11 month lease turned into a nightmare. The apartment was filled with lead in the ducts making air unbreathable, The landlord would not fix even essential appliances like the oven.

But it gave me a new perspective. I changed a lot of things because of that, and once I got out of the psych ward in hospital I've put a request for change of shift.

I work for a transit company, and we provide the only real mass transit in my city. Recently we launched an exciting new BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) line. This route has been in planning for years, and ever since I started working here I've been involved with planning, tracking, outreach, etc. It was exciting to launch it, we had the news here, tons of people, 200 volunteers from the city, and all sorts of other things. We had live bands playing at some of the stops, a DJ at the transit center, and a ribbon cutting at city hall. The exciting part about this line is that it uses a fleet of full electric vehicles, they emit almost no pollutants, and are extremely quiet. There were some hiccups. Ridership was much higher than we anticipated, so the buses were going much slower than intended. Usually the buses will run every 10 minutes, the whole line should take about an hour and a half to complete a full round trip. The line runs North to South, and we were pushing 35-45 minute wait times. The buses were so packed that we eventually had to turn people away if it was too full. After the launch we received some complaints due to timing issues. We fixed those by adding more buses to the routes. Another complaint we had was that bus stations (these are center lane stations) were causing congestion, so we improved traffic light switches for bus only lanes, to minimize the time at each stop. The city was excited and came out in force, and it made all the hard work worth it. I feel like we dropped the ball in some places, but man we did our best, and I'm so proud of my team and myself. We did some fun activities that entire week, and we have some other fun stuff in the works.

While I waited for that to be finished, I signed in so that the city could keep track of the amount of volunteer hours that everyone preformed.

The reason for me going there was because I was going to meet a special friend of mine I hadn't seen in over a year. I was extremely nervous as flying is a very nerve-wracking experience for me. I'm also incredibly shy and don't like being in places full of people. On the plane I was so scared of everything. The person next to me was an older woman who didn't seem to mind at all. I couldn't sleep at all and mostly just sat there waiting to land. When we finally did I felt relieved but also so exhausted. When I saw my friend it was like all my energy had returned. I was so happy to see him and ran up and hugged him really hard. I could tell he was happy to see me too! He drove us back to his place and my exhaustion finally caught up with me and after we spoke for a bit I passed out on his couch for a few hours. Luckily he was understanding of this. When I got back up we spent a lot of time talking. It was so refreshing to hear his voice again and listening to him tell me about how his life was in London brought me a lot of joy. I stayed at his place for over a week while we saw all the sights together. I was nervous a lot of the time being in a new country and so far away from home. I also felt a little isolated being around so many people from a different country than I. All of those feelings paled in how happy I felt being around him though.

I went to the doctor and was prescribed Sertraline. The medication helped with the anxiety immediately. I continued on the course prescribed by my doctor: continue taking the Sertraline and increase the dose at regular weekly intervals. I began taking the smallest dose, 25 milligrams. In the following weeks I upped the dose to 50mg, then 100mg, then 150mg. After several days on the 150mg dose, I began feeling somewhat ill with stomach problems and a bit of increased anxiety. I was informed enough to know that these were symptoms of a potentially dangerous condition known as seratonin syndrome which is caused by elevated levels of seratonin in one's system. I immediately reduced my dosage of the Sertraline to 100mg. Knowing that I had another follow-up appointment with my doctor several days later I assumed that my seratonin levels would drop by the time of the appointment and then we could discuss weaning myself off of the Sertraline. In the time leading up to the appointment my seratonin levels continued to spike though, and while the negative symptoms were increasing (hyperactivity, shakiness, muscle tremors) the spike also triggered a breakthrough in my depression that was so powerful I can only equate it to what one might call a ""spiritual"" awakening. I went to my docotr's appointment as planned. I explained the situation and events and was put on an accelerated plan to get off of the medication. It took several days to come down from the seratonin syndrome, but after that I still felt the positive effects of the breakthrough. With the weight of the depression lifted I've been able to devote more energy to self-care activities such as going to the gym and meditation.";I went on antidepressants to deal with anxiety and depression. After having an alarming reaction to the medication I did actually have a breakthrough and have been doing better since.;15;315;truthful;32;9;confident
3208;3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q4OLEIY;It started as an ordinary day.  I was heading out for the day to run some errands.  Once I pulled out of my driveway, I noticed my gas light was on, and decided I should pull off and get some gas before I started.  I pulled into the Walmart Gas Station, just a few blocks from home.   I pulled up to the pump, and put my car in park.  I got my wallet out of my purse and began to pull my money out to pay.  As I was pulling a twenty dollar bill out, I began to hear arguing, and yelling next to me.  I looked up and out my passenger window and noticed an older man and a younger man screaming at one another.  Both men were very aggressive, and I was a little nervous by the scene.  I sat frozen in my seat, watching the confrontation.  Suddenly, the older man went to his car and opened the driver door and reached inside.  As I watched, he pulled a can of mace out of the car and proceeded to spray the other man in the face with it.  To my left side, a person came out of the door of the gas station.  This person was apparently unaware of the altercation, and was the next person to be maced by the angry older man.  I was stunned, and still safe inside my car when I saw a few people run to the older man, get sprayed and attempt to take the mace from him.  Once I saw the mace was out of the older mans hands, I got out of my car to help the gentleman that was maced leaving the store to turn the hose water on to rinse his hands and face.  Someone had already called the police and at this point they were pulling onto the gas station.  The older man was arrested, I was asked to give a statement, as were the other witnesses.  I was so happy that I didn't get out in the middle of that situation, or get maced.;I made an innocent stop at a local gas station before running some errands.

3311;3OSWBBLG1FJHEI2AI1CRPC6KR16DX9;A memorable event that happened to me recently was during a trip to Anchorage, Alaska in early April. This is the earliest in the year that I have been to Alaska, and the entire trip was cold and full of snow. This was very surprising and unexpected given the weather forecast, but I had a wonderful trip anyway. It was starting to get hot at home in Ohio, so I was welcoming the cold. I traveled by myself and had many spiritual experiences in both urbanized Alaska and in the wilderness. One of the most memorable parts was visiting the Eklutna spirit houses, which are one of my favorite locations in the world. The spirit houses are traditional yupik burial grounds. Since the permafrost, even in Southcentral Alaska is very hard, burials are traditionally not performed in the ground. Rather, remains are placed on top of the earth, and a small house is hand-built around them. Each spirit house is a work of art, and they were mostly made by friends and/or family of the deceased. I can spend hours there every time I visit to wander among the houses and to learn about the people that are resting there. I am surrounded by a sense of death and peace when visiting there, and going there is always an intense, emotional, visceral experience. I felt connected to the entire earth and to the native peoples that are eternally resting there. I stayed for hours thinking about my partner, my history, and my purpose in life. It was truly a life-changing experience. I come away from Eklutna with a sense of renewed purpose every time I visit. It is a truly amazing place, and one I hope to return to someday to continue my spiritual journeys there.;The memorable event I experienced was visiting the Eklutna spirit houses north of Anchorage, Alaska.

We live in a small house close to the college that I attended and I am a full time father. Most times I dress up to go to school, my daughter would run after me crying to come along.

This, together with youtube videos made her know about attending school and always wanted to attend school. I got her enrolled for head start and she was enrolled to start on August 26th, 2019. before this date, she would pick up her uniform and cry to go to school. Not long, the resumption date came and she got dressed and I dropped her off. She was so happy to be there, she was amongst the few students in her class that did not cry that their parents dropped them of.

During the class we began discussing the meaning of love, how it manifests itself in relationships and how it is seen within the universe. One of the things about the class that impressed me was the teacher's clarity that love is undefined and unconditioned. nit does not fluctuate much like the human conception, but instead it is a powerful force that can be said formed the universe. After the class we all had a chance to talk and converse what was shared. My friends were overjoyed that I would invite them to such a program because it was something that touched the hearts of all of us. Some people felt love was like An ocean in which we all swam or floated or drowned. Others felt that love was like a tree that ascended towards the heavens and humbled itself deep into the earth. Then there were some that felt love was a hummingbird that sought nectar from all of life. I could not help but agre with all three sentiments and feel that love takes many forms. some of these forms are seen in relationships between two people. Another form is between a parent and a child. There is also the form of love between friends which is most equal. There also exists a form of love between a teacher and a student. One can also see love between animals that care for their young or their mate. Love appears in many forms indeed. My feeling is that it's best to express rather to repress ones love.

While waiting in line I was talking to a really nice lady and she was telling me about the business she owned and how she didn't want to get called in because she was going on vacation soon.

3770;3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGD4VFZC;My husband recently retired from the post office after 30 years of employment. He wanted to leave but I did not want him to retire yet. He had promised that he would stay at his job until our car was paid off, but his supervisors and managers at work have bullied employees on an everyday basis and have just made people miserable. We went to counseling several times and he was also prescribed medication to help him deal with the stress, but there came a point that he couldn't take it anymore. So about 2 months ago, he resigned. This situation has also caused me a lot of stress. Neither of us are old enough to collect Social Security and my husband's retirement money will cost us a 10% penalty if he withdraws it before age 59 and 1/2. So I'm keeping my eye out for a job and we've been working on sorting out our finances to decide what we need and what we can live without. My own doctor has readjusted my anti-depressant and anti-anxiety meds which has seemed to help with my stress and energy levels. I don't talk about this much to others because it sounds burdensome and I know that other people have enough problems of their own. I feel very lucky to have a good psychiatrist. My husband sees the same doctor as myself. Sometimes I feel guilty about complaining because we're still better off than a lot of people. We have enough money to live on. The change in my meds has helped significantly and I don't feel the extreme stress that I felt when this first began. I think it's mainly difficult because it is a new stage of our lives with lots of big changes which can make a person feel off balance and uncertain.;My husband recently retired before either of us were ready. We're in the midst of learning to cope with less money. We've cut way back on our spending and are concentrating on paying down debts which has been very stressful.;16;304;truthful;37;9;confident

Myself and 2 other family members who reside in Michigan decided to drive to the wedding. Because I do not fly on planes due to a fear of flying. We decided to make some fun stops on the way to Florida.  We stopped at a small town store. I bought my granddaughter a very unique gift that was hand made by a woman who was 90 years old. When we arrived in Florida we stayed with a niece in a small quaint house. The wedding was beautiful. I was very surprised that my high school boyfriend from years ago was at the wedding. It was good to see him, and he was doing well. My granddaughter wore my daughter's wedding dress. My granddaughter had some changes made to the dress but it was just as beautiful.

She had said she was ready to go, but it was still, of course, a sad moment in my life. She had gotten really frail overall and was in a nursing home the last few weeks of her life. The last time I saw her, she was asleep, and didn't wake up while I was there, but I was able to tell her that I loved her and that I hoped she had sweet dreams. It felt good to be able to do that. When we got the call, I wasn't surprised. But I still miss her, of course. She was a really interesting person. She was born to Belgian immigrants. She grew up on a farm with no electricity or running water. She had a really happy life though, and did more than she ever expected. Her funeral was really nice. A lot of people came.

Two weeks ago they had a function at school to meet the teacher so we went and we got to play for a little bit. The kids in her class are just so adorable. She has a friend  and when we met him for the first time he was just so respectful and so silly. Just a typical four year old child. i remember going up to him and playing with him. He was playing in the play kitchen area with a couple other students and I walked up to him and asked what he was making. He was no nice, he made me a 'pizza'. It was fake of course.

I took my dad to Veterans Hospital for his yearly check-up and the doctors were very concerned because his blood pressure reached up to 195 and the doctors went into full panic mode. This was one of the numbest days I have experienced in a long time. The doctors rushed and gave him medicine to get his blood pressure down. The doctor told me that he could of had a stroke or a heart attack. I was shocked. Even though I know my dad is 77, he is very active and in good health.  He hates going to the doctors and he truly would not have went unless he had to. I feel like I have to be more responsible for his health now. He looks like he is 50, but the reality is he's not. I just can't imagine loosing him. I have to dedicate myself to making sure he's okay. I know its hard but I have to do it. I am still worried about him. The doctors were great and compassionate.

3856;3RXPCZQMQQXC01R8DYSS0O5GAXN1G8;On May 15, 2019 was the day my Father-in-Law  passed away. It's been a tough couple of years as I seen my Father-in-Law struggle with his breathing. He was diagnosis with pulmonary lung disease back 2018 but probably had this disease long before that time.  He was a vibrant man considering his age of being 80.  He lived on a farm raising cattle and always took care of his chores until he no longer could. My husband and brother-in-law had to take over the family farm. Eventually the situation started taking a hold on the families since we all lived an hour away. His prognosis wasn't good but he kept persevering until he could no longer take care of himself or the farm. He did not want to go into a home so we called hospice and they helped a couple times a week with the rest of us helping the other days. Towards the end my Father-in-Law had to use an oxygen tank. I noticed every time I seen him he kept loosing weight. He had so much fluid on his lungs that he was no longer hungry. He was wasting away to nothing. We finally had hospice bring a bed into his house and place it in the living room. He no longer had energy to walk to his bedroom. I knew the end was near. We took turns with staying over night at his house as he was now in need of 24 hour care. The night that me and my husband were staying with him he wanted us to say a prayer together.  After that he said he loved us and was really tired. We told him we loved him and to get some rest.  At about 1 in the morning we heard a noise and we both got up. We went to the living room to see my Father-in-Law coughing, chocking, and having a hard time breathing.  He eventually fell back to sleep.  A couple hours went by and we both woke to my Father-in-Law letting out a gurgle. We both held his hand and he eventually passed away.;This story is about how my Father-in-Law struggled with Pulmonary Lung Disease and the events that let up to his passing.

3878;3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPR1FMD81;About two months ago, I did not have a job because I had just graduated. I was used to working part-time jobs, and was not making that much. At the time, I was very depressed and stressed about my financial situation because I was in debt, broke, and had over $200,000 worth of student loans. I was at the end of my road because I was waking up extremely sad every day and I felt like I had nothing to live for. I was discouraged because I had been applying for jobs for months prior to graduating but everyone said i was applying too early and that I needed more experience. The longer I was unemployed the more depressed I had gotten. At this point, I was losing so much weight I was down to about 90 pounds and my appetite was pretty much non-existent. I decided that I needed to do something because I felt myself going to a very dark place that was scary to think about and I felt like I was going to end up doing something irrational that I would regret. I needed help but didn't want to ask anyone for help. I decided that I needed to get up and get my life together. One particular morning I woke up and applied to at least 30 jobs in one day. I was determined to find a job because I knew that would solve at least some of my problems. It would provide me with a stable full-time salary so I would be able to take care of some of my debt and other financial obligations. The next day, I decided that I needed to talk to someone, so I called a help hotline. I was on the phone with a specialist for about an hour and a half and she was able to help me feel better. The specialist boosted my confidence and gave me some tools that I could use next time I was feeling depressed or stressed. About a week later, I got called for an interview that I was really interested in.

3914;3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEDBZDTI;A little over a month ago my husband and I traveled to the Washington D.C. area so that my husband could have surgery on his back at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. It was my first time ever being to the nation's capital, and with one day before my husband's surgery, we attempted to walk all over downtown DC and see as many monuments as possible before we had to be back at Walter Reed and ready for surgery the next morning. We traveled downtown on the Metro, and ended up getting off a short distance from the Capital, where we started. We then saw the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial (my main reason for wanting to go downtown!), the World War 2 Memorial, the Korean Memorial, and Vietnam Memorial. We then took the metro back to Walter Reed, where we were staying on base for the next couple of weeks. Side note, I was really impressed by the strategic placing of water vendors throughout the different monuments, with water, Gatorade, popsicles, etc. I don't know if it's a good use of their life, but we really appreciated them being there! The thing that stood out to me about the monuments was the realization that the Lincoln Memorial literally just had Lincoln's statue in it. I seriously thought that there might be more, maybe a museum commemorating his achievements or something, but it really had just his statue. I might have been a little disappointed, but still impressed at the imposing presence Lincoln was, even if just carved in stone. What also stuck out to me while we were downtown was the World War 2 Memorial. I honestly didn't expect to be impressed by that memorial. But the different quotes placed around the structure really helped the memorial pop in my mind. I enjoy reading, and reading wisdom from those gone before us, who went through such a horrific time. So, I appreciated that monument more than I expected to. I'm really glad I was able to get the chance to see a small part of our Capital even though our reason for being there wasn't necessarily ideal.;While on a trip to Walter Reed for my husband's back surgery, we got to spend a day exploring downtown Washington D.C.

Or else!!The wedding began, we (we were ushers at the wedding) took our places on the stairs leading up to the dais, and stood respectfully watching the ceremony. Perfectly reverent. As we stood there, we casually glanced over at the bridesmaids who were across from us on the steps, and noticed one of them was slightly swaying. We continued to watch as her swaying became more pronounced, and then she proceeded to fall over like a fresh cut tree right between the bride and groom. Out like a light. Total chaos ensued, but we continued to stand stoically as directed. After a brief pause to take in the moment (and share a wink and nod with my counterpart) I stepped up, picked up the still unconscious young lady, and carried her to a side room where she was treated and soon recovered.

While I usually love being pregnant, this one was a little harder on me both physically and mentally. I was constantly exhausted due to running around with a 3 year old and one year old every day. When I found out I was pregnant we had planned on waiting a few years before deciding if we wanted a third child, but we were very surprised when I got a positive pregnancy test.

4103;3TOK3KHVJU4E30N8QXM9675V45EO7F;I have an day here in my financial record the time of debt I had from driving an car. Not one car but two, the 98 Ford Mustang the later matching my last name of the Ford expedition. AN tour with an Army unit the first time buyer cost jumped out the roof. My unknown phenomenon was credited to my version of street racing. When Ford Motor all but eliminated passenger cars from its North American lineup earlier this month to concentrate on trucks and S.U.V.s, it turned the page on a long and storied history of now-defunct but once red-hot nameplates: the Model T, the Model A, the Galaxie, the Fairlane, the Thunderbird and the Falcon, to name several. There was one conspicuous survivor: the Mustang.“Get rid of the Mustang?” asked James D. Farley Jr., Ford’s president of global markets, when I asked him this week how the Mustang had survived. “The Mustang is like Rocky: It survived the 1970s fuel crisis, the glam 1980s, the move to S.U.V.s. It’s made it through every round of cuts.”For me, the Mustang’s reprieve came as welcome news: I took my driver’s test in my mother’s 1967 turquoise Mustang notchback. On the rare occasions I was allowed to drive it, it conferred instant status and triggered unabashed envy among my high school classmates. Wall Street probably would have been just as happy to see the Mustang go the way of the Fusion, Taurus and Fiesta, current models that Ford said it would phase out and which Mr. Farley dismissed as “commodity silhouettes.” (Ford says it will continue to make passenger vehicles, but they just won’t be in the shape of today’s sedan. The Focus, for example, will survive, but as a crossover S.U.V.)That’s because in its last earnings report, Ford revealed for the first time that a relatively small number of products, including the hugely popular F-150 pickup truck series, accounted for 150 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes, with profit margins in the midteens. Another group was barely profitable. By contrast, Ford said its “low performing” products lost money, with negative margins of more than 10 percent.;Around the time of this, there were very few external changes made to the Mustang. The interior was also very similar, though the clock was integrated into the stereo system, which is an easy way to tell the difference between the 1997 and 1998 Mustang.;21;358;truthful;42;10;very confident

It was our second time to Europe together but the first time to Paris.  After the long flight, we got on the train to take it in to the city.  We went straight to the hotel and rested for a bit.  We then took the subway in to the heart of Paris.  As we stepped out in to the sunlight from underneath the ground, the first site we say was Notre Dame Cathedral in all of it's splendor.  My wife started crying and I was overwhelmed at the sites and sounds of Paris.  It is beautiful.  Little did we know that Notre Dame would be burning down a few days later.  The most memorable part of this experience happened inside of Notre Dame.  As we walked in, we realized a mass had just started.  We heard the most beautiful music.  We sat down and experienced the mass.  Since my wife knows French, she told me what the priest was saying.

4213;3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQFACNRD;On day in late June, I was walking to my local post office to drop off a package. On my way there,  I saw a sign for a blood donation drive that was occurring that day. They desperately needed people to offer their blood. On impulse I decided to go in and donate. I was a first time blood donor so the volunteers and nurses put me through a screening process and gave me a questionnaire. I passed the screening and proceeded to donate my blood. The process itself had no complications and took about 15 minutes. Afterwards I sat at a table where there were cookies and apple juice. I felt fine at first but within a few minutes I started to feel dizzy. All of a sudden, I keeled over and went into a dream world. When I woke up, I was lying down, face up, and the nurses and volunteers told me I had fainted. They tried to stabilize me, but I fainted again and had to be brought to the hospital. I was put on IVs for a couple of hours. Although I had a severe reaction to donating blood, and I sustained injuries as a result of fainting, I still consider it a positive experience because I potentially saved someone else's life and had so many people helping me, like the volunteers, nurses, and EMT.  I felt so much humanity that day.;In June, I decided to donate blood at a local drive. I was a first time donor and after a screening donated with no complications.

I was a major part in starting this program back in the summer of 2009. Since the beginning our our program we have fielded about 65 teams. 3 of them have won our league championship. This summer I took a team that had a losing record and tried to become the 4th team in our history to complete a championship run.  The season started off well and the boys responded well to all the training and upgraded competition.  We found ourselves as the number 2 seed in our division and the number 6 seed overall out of 45 teams. Things turned for the worst when we lost to a team we had beat 4 times earlier. We needed to win the next 2 games and keep our runs against down just to advance into the playoffs as a wildcard team. Somehow we found a way and won 2 very close games. The next morning we played in the quarterfinal against the team we lost to prior. Let’s just say the boys came to play. It was our biggest margin of victory the entire season. Our semifinal game was a nail bitter. This ended up as a 1 run game that we won in the last inning of play. On to the Championship the boys were on cloud nine! It was amazing watching them play with confidence and finally realizing they were the best team on the field. We took an early lead and never looked back. Finishing off the season with a 8-5 win and a record of 42-8. What an amazing season, one that I will never forget!;Baseball team wins 4th league championship in 10 years, this was a battle from behind and an epic finish.

We wanted to open up a vintage store, mainly video games and collectible card and board games. So we needed about $50,000. We were working some pretty dead end jobs, just a bunch of college dropouts. Joseph get's the great idea that we join a intermediate bowling tournament. The top prize was $20,000. We were all apart of the bowling team at the high school we attended together. We knew we would never go pro but we were pretty good. So we sign up for this tournament. After a month of practice, the weekend of the tournament had arrived. We played 3 games on Saturday and beat all of our competitors but a smooth 50 or more points. We were now in the semi-finals and finals scheduled for Sunday. Perry hurt his thumb in our last game on Saturday but was able to keep it together and see us to the finals.

4254;3UN61F00HXB2D915UWOG2IW4C955RQ;Approximately four months ago, I attended my annual work conference. However, this conference was unique to the extent that I was actively looking for a new job this year. As a result, my conference was filled with job interviews rather than attending sessions. While this would seem to be a distinct event during the conference, and any one of these interviews would classify as a memorable event, the most memorable event actually came from something other than an interview. That is, I had planned and organized a session for the conference. As part of this session, I had enlisted the help of another person to act as a discussion leader to tie together the other presentations. This person is widely regarded within my field, and would attract a large audience. However, approximately one hour before the session, he emailed me to tell me that he had food poisoning. As a result, he would be unable to attend the session. This left me in a bit of a bind. With approximately one hour to prepare, I was forced to take on the discussant role - having never done so before. In so doing, it would be painfully obvious that I had little time to prepare. However, when it came time for the session, the other presentations went longer than anticipated, fortunately leaving me less time to lead the discussion. This had the effect of masking my lack of preparedness. As such, the discussion went relatively smoothly, even though I had no prior experience doing so in this setting. In sum, this session was memorable due to the late change and excuse from my enlisted discussion leader. However, it was also memorable because it pushed me outside of my comfort zone and helped me grow.;This story deals with an unexpected occurrence during a recent conference of mine.

My husband had worked his job for over eight years and life seemed to be moving well. We enjoyed our new town living close by in our camper. We knew it would be a few months until we could move on our property while living in our RV. It just happened that the day we went to closed on our property my husband received a phone from his work. He had just lost his job. It could not have come at a worse time. We were just hours away from closing on the the property and start the house building process.

For the past year I've been trying out various Buddhist practices - particularly a lot of different meditation techniques. Sitting meditation can cause a lot of pain to arise in the body for me, and instead of working through that like I should, I've started to do a lot of walking meditation instead. This of course leads to its own types of pain, but they're more manageable. Anyway, recently I had been doing my walking meditation as usual. I like to do an hour a day whenever I can since I work from home and can leave my computer for short times here and there. I usually break this down into 10-15 minute sessions just to make it easier to get the practice in without disturbing my work day too much. One late afternoon/early evening I was doing my walking and reached a very peaceful and tranquil state. My mind was significantly more quiet than it usually is, although there were still thoughts bubbling up here and there. I also realized at the time that the movement in my mind was starting to slow down. My mind was no longer jumping from one thought to another endlessly. This mental state continued for a few minutes as I continued to pace back and forth on my walking path and just observed it. After I finished that feeling of peace and tranquility lingered for a while before fading away. I've had some pretty strange and interesting experiences so far while exploring these different techniques.

We all wanted to meet there this year to have a celebration for my mom's birthday. My father and mother are no longer together but my father happens to be in Ghana also. We had a party for my mother and it was a successful event. After the event I went out with my two brothers to enjoy the rest of the evening. While we were out there having fun I saw this beautiful young lady. I really liked her so I try to talk to her but she wouldn't pay me no mind. I kept trying but she wouldn't give me her attention. I think it was because she was with her mother. Soon her mom left her alone to get something, so I tried again and I was able to get her number.

So my father agreed with me getting to know her and possible marrying her. We arrange an event for her parent to come meet with my parent for us to discuss if I can marry her. We had the meeting and everything went well and now I am preparing to marry her in 2021. For now we are taking it slowly.

Why couldn't I have helped her? I just didn't know anything was wrong inside of her. Her passing showed me that I need to reach out more to others and help them if I feel like I should. I need to ask how they're doing more often or just offer to come see them and be more friendly. When I think back on our long conversations, I never remember her seeming like she needed more.

4679;3X66WABAJX48A45N026BOHKDWUXG3P;My younger sister and I were very close to each other and we tell secrets that nobody in my family could know. We have an elder sister but because she move out the house early so I was responsible to take charge on taking care of my little sister.  Growing up was so easy for us to enjoy because we have each others back. I would always protect her and she will always be my shoulder to cry on.  Then there came the time that I had to leave the house and marry my husband. I think it was a heartbreaking and emotional part of leaving her and wont be able to see her for a long time. I had to stay of different side of the country. Five months ago, I had a call from my mom and she was sobbing. I was so scared why she was acting like that. Then she told me the big news that my little sister was diagnosed with Epilepsy. I felt my jaw dropped and my body is numb. I couldnt hear anyone and all the things just turned blank. Tears fell on my cheeks and there my little sister came. I didnt saw all the signs but my mother said it happened when I was away from home. She was able to keep the secret from me because she knew I wont leave her if I knew that was happening to her. She is a very brave on handling the Epilepsy. She had all the test and taking medication to prevent her from falling and jerking. I cant believe my sister is going thru this pain. She was positive in her outlook in life and she told me that is everything is okay and dont want me to think about it. She said she accept and dont want to dwell into negativity. But thank God for a new chapter of her life;My sister and I are best friends and I was her protector. She was diagnosed with Epilepsy and I wasnt able to be with her because Im away from home. But she was very brave and had a positive perspective in her life that is why she doesnt think that she is sick.;21;321;truthful;48;10;very confident
4685;3X73LLYYQ20TE4T82R88IVUKGL7NH1;"Hmm well one day about a month or two ago I went to see the new Avenger's movie. I couldn't finish it and as I was walking around downtown heading to my car, a man was convinced that I was the lead singer of the sexdolls who played the night before. ""I wish! I said laughing."" He said I looked just like him and that they put on a good show. It appeared we both were heading the same direction after that and I was very surprised when he said he wasn't convinced I'm telling him the truth - thats how much alike I must look to the lead singer of the sexdolls. I took it as a compliment even though I've no idea who they are or if they're even good. That's all I have to write.. I hope these shapes stop flashing soon. Perhaps I should give details. It was very hot outside and I hadn't showered that day, so my hair was not as poofy as I like it. This did not stop the man who was stricken with surprise. We had some nice small talk as well.

4691;3X87C8JFV7X37AKGTDCOQ3WR6K9QSC;About a month ago, I went out on a date for the first time since my divorce in 2015. It was kind of nerve wracking getting ready for it since I hadn't done anything like this since like going on a date since early 2000s. I had no idea what to wear, what I would say or how to act. We had decided to go out to dinner so I made sure to bring gum so my breath wouldn't smell after eating. We met at the restaurant and it was pretty awkward at first. We kind of hugged and introduced ourselves. I remember sweating a little because I was pretty nervous about this date with such a beautiful woman. I was wondering what she was thinking when we were seated at the table. We quickly ordered and then just started chatting about our interests. I made sure to order something easy to eat like chicken strips. I didn't want to make a huge mess or look like a pig. After about 10 minutes of chatting about what we liked to do and what we didn't like to do, the conversation flowed much more easily. I wasn't nervous anymore and she seemed more at ease. Our food finally came and neither of us ate much of our meals. That was probably because we didn't want to seem like pigs in front of each other on a first date. We then finished and went out to a bar for a couple of drinks. We had fun and really had a good time.;I went out on a date for the first time since my divorce and first time in over a decade.

The splashpad we were planning to have the party at, the one that the city said would be finished being worked on, was still under construction. I had to move the party to my mother's house, which is very stressful. On the same day of her party, we were trying to adopt a dog. I went to the grocery store to get everything for the party, went to the adoption shelter, and realized I had left my wallet at the store. So, we didn't get to look at any dogs. I started crying, because I felt like I was disappointing the kids. Finally, we got back to my mom's house, took a small nap, and then went to the pool to swim. That was the best part for me. We swam for about an hour before the party even started. I had time to set everything up nicely, as well. From there, things were smooth until Autumn puked up unicorn cake on the sidewalk. I had to clean up at the end of the day and that was a ton of mess, also. In the end, Khloe said it was the best birthday and she loved it. That is all that matters.;Khloe had an eventful and crazy birthday. All the planning I had done, was not going to make the day easier.

He seriously looks like he is right out of a fairy tale. He is the absolute sweetest boy ever. I think he would spend hours just letting you brush on him and give him attention. He loves to have his ears scratched and makes the most adorable face when you do. I have been looking for a horse just like him for months. I went out on a limb to purchase him because he was not exactly what I was looking for, but from the minute I saw him I knew it was love. He has only had one other owner his whole life so I know his background and training. He has no hidden ghosts in his closet, unlike Bourbon. His name was Tucker but he is being renamed to Butter because he really does look like a stick of butter. My daughter loves him and thinks that he is just the best thing ever. She has now renamed several of her toy horses after him. I am ecstatic that I found him and that he is going to work out perfect for us.

You see, I had not seen my father for 2 years before he died because of very hectic lives on both our parts. When I was a little girl, I was very spiritual and was having a conversation with my dad about life after death. He was not a believer but told me that when he died he would come visit me to confirm it's realness if it was so. Fast forward to adulthood again, and about 1 month before he died we were talking on the phone and he stated that we have to see each other soon. He was afraid that he did not have much time left here. He needed to see his baby girl quickly. He soon passed but came to me my dreams dressed in white. He was smiling broadly, and around 30 years old. He had no eyes because what replaced them was wisp of spirit I could see clearly in them I knew he was fulfilling his promise to me when I was a little girl. This has reaffirmed my spirituality and faith. I am forever happy to have had him here. The experience has made me stronger. The be experience has made me love more.

I always forget how little my dog is, I'm always calling him my little man or my little grandpa. He acts like an old man, grunting, huffing, yes my dog with huff at you in disapproval. We had no clue he was sick until one night he just fell out in the floor and released his bladder, unresponsive, weak, stiff as a board, eyes open, looked like he had died. It was very scary not knowing what to do, do you move him? do you leave him alone? does he need CPR? I was so scared and I am a mother of 2 grown sons. He continued to have 2 more of these episodes throughout the night, morning could not get here fast enough. We took our little man to the vet, he was scared and unsure, like always.

4805;3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8DKTE41Q;I read a book about a woman's cells who have greatly shaped science, medicine, and vaccines. She had cervical cancer in her 30's and a part of her tumor was taken to see if the cells could be kept alive in culture. It resulted that her cells not only stayed alive, they thrived and reproduced very easily. Her cells are now considered immortal. However, what really touched me emotionally and what was most memorable was reading about how she got cervical cancer. She got cervical cancer due to being exposed to different strains of HPV by her husband numerous times, a fact which was only discovered decades later. Due to that finding, a vaccine was formulated to reduce the risk of cervical cancer in women. Reading that immediately prompted me to read more about the HPV vaccine and it's dosage requirements and effectiveness. I remembered that I had only had one dosage so far. As such, reading about this woman who died as a result of being infected by her husband really made me angry at the fact that there was no way for her to have known this could have happened to her. To me, reading about this woman's life validated the need for me to get my second and third dose of the vaccine although I had gotten the first dose more than 2 years ago. She suffered immensely in the last few months of her life and her family also suffered her loss due to something that in this day and age is preventable. Reading about her story opened my eyes about not just cancer, but HPV and the importance of being vaccinated against it. Due to this book I sought out extra medical information that further educated me about the matter and motivated me to contact my health care provider. It also prompted me to have a conversation with my siblings about it. I know that it is in my hands and that I have the resources to continue my HPV immunizations and after reading this book it seems foolish for me not to.;I read a book about a woman who had cervical cancer and died as a result.

I can't go into too many details with this, but the previous event cost the company revenue because of something I overlooked.  I was written up and was put on corrective action for three months.  This was something similar that happened, but through a loophole I escaped scott free.  A process change was implemented in the process.  I was getting anxious as this meeting went on that I was not a part of, but my supervisor kept me in the loop over instant messenger.  I was told of what's going on and that I'm not in trouble due to me being instructed how to perform the process.  I ended up deciding to speak to my primary care doctor about going on anti-anxiety medication.  The anxiety that previously caused my ill feelings was  subsided because of the medication.  I was told I looked more relaxed at work and not as tense.  I'm feeling much better now and hope to move forward.  I'm no longer dwelling on my stressors.  I met with my therapist today to talk about my stressors and she felt I was doing a lot better.  Usually when something like this happens, the only thing that comes to mind is how I'm going to be laid off.  It's difficult to deal with and I now deal with things a lot better so far.

Without any hesitation, I said yes and started to plan my trip.  I drove from California to Pennsylvania and visited lots of beautiful sites that my friend would have also enjoyed.  I finally made it to Pittsburgh after four days of driving and returned the car back to his family.  I spent a week in the hospital visiting my friend, because on my road trip he ended up having a seizure and had to be admitted.  My friend had looked a lot different from the last time I saw him.  It broke my heart but I knew it would make me stronger.  Every single day I spent at the hospital to be there with his family. In this time, I really grew with his parents who I never really knew before.  I was able to get in contact with lots of friends who had no idea he was in the hospital and they were able to pay him a visit. I felt like I was able to send an army to help his family deal with all of this.  While in Pittsburgh, I was staying with my parents, and I do not get along with my dad well.  But going to the hospital brought me comfort and joy even though it was such a sad time.  When it was finally time to leave to fly back to California, my friend's dad dropped me off at the hospital.

He had recently started a company with the dream of running his own business in the next year or two but we were not prepared for that to start immediately!  His boss discovered his new company and fired him on the spot.  No two weeks notice, no time to prepare.  Thank God he had some vacation time saved up so we weren't completely screwed financially.  Many concerns crossed my mind.  How will we afford food?  How will we pay our mortgage?  How will we send our kids to the private school that they love and thrive at?  My husband and I both worked diligently over the next few weeks to get everything set up for the business that we thought we would have a year to accomplish.  We opened a bank account, fixed up the website, created a LinkedIn account, and started emailed companies looking for work.  He also attended a conference to try to make some connections there.  Many people were interested in his capabilities but it takes time to get a contract officially signed.  My husband created his first blog post and it quickly received a significant amount of attention from the tech community.
